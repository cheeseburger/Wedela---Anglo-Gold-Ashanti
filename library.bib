abstract = {A new spectral bin microphysical scheme (SBM) was implemented into
the Weather Research and Forecasting model referred to as Fast-SBM,
which uses a smaller number of size distribution functions than the
original version of the scheme referred to as Exact-SBM. It was shown
that both schemes produced similar dynamical and microphysical structure
of a squall line simulated. An excellent agreement in the simulated
precipitation amounts between the schemes was found within a range
of cloud condensation nuclei concentrations from 100 to 3000 cm-3.
The Fast-SBM requires about 40{\%} of the computing power of the Exact-SBM,
allowing it to be used for real-time simulations over limited domains.
The results obtained using the SBM simulations have been compared
with those using a modified version of the Thompson bulk parameterization
scheme. The main extension of the bulk scheme was the implementation
of the process of drop nucleation, so that drop concentration is
no longer prescribed a priori but rather calculated using the prescribed
aerosol concentration. This scheme is referred to as the Drop scheme.
A large set of sensitivity studies have been performed, in which
microphysical parameters and precipitation, droplet nucleation above
cloud base, etc., have been compared with those obtained from SBM.
The SBM scheme produces more realistic dynamical and microphysical
structure of the squall line. The Drop scheme did relatively little
to change the cloud structures simulated by the bulk scheme. Unlike
the SBM simulations that show different precipitation sensitivities
to aerosol concentrations in relatively dry and humid environments,
the Drop scheme indicates monotonic decrease in precipitation with
increasing aerosol concentrations.},

abstract = {Hail growth is studied in the Westplains, Colorado, storm for which a variety of observations were collected. Measurements from a triple-Doppler radar network and a penetrating aircraft are used to synthesize fields of liquid water content and three-dimensional, evolving air motion from which detailed hail growth trajectories are computed. Explicit treatment of the growth of hail embryos is sidestepped. Rather, for the purpose of the study a wide range of embryo sizes is assumed to exist over a broad region of the storm and the analysis examines which particles are predicted to grow and what their growth trajectories are. Sensitivity of individual trajectories to many parameter such as initial position, embryo size, and particle drag law, is found. However, the general results, including the following, are insensitive: the storm flow field is organized such that an efficient mechanism exists for transporting particles into the updraft; following growth of the embryo outside the large updraft, a single pass though the updraft is sufficient to account for hail of the observed maximum size (1.5- 2.0 cm); fall-out positions and growth times are consistent with the observations; growth takes place primarily between -10 and -25°C. A wide variety of interweaving trajectories is predicted. In general they conform to the supercell model of Browning and Foote, though several differences are noted. Hail apparently can grow in the storm from a wide range of initial positions, but the favorable initial region for the smaller and more numerous embryos that are expected to dominate the hail production is more restricted. The width of the updraft is found to be an important factor in limiting hail growth in the storm. Melting during fall-out is also significant. The present results are shown to be consistent with a generalized hailstorm model termed an open-cell simple-trajectory model. By this it is meant that (a) the embryo stage of growth occurs outside the large updraft in which (b) the hail itself grows by making a single traverse, as opposed to following several looping "trajectories. Evidence supporting the general importance of this mode of behavior of hailstorms is presented. Alternative theories using them concepts are also discussed.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the status of forecasting convective precipitation
for time periods less than a few hours (nowcasting). Techniques for
nowcasting thunderstorm location were developed in the 1960s and
1970s by extrapolating radar echoes. The accuracy of these forecasts
generally decreases very rapidly during the first 30 min because
of the very short lifetime of individual convective cells. Fortunately
more organized features like squall lines and supercells can be successfully
extrapolated for longer time periods. Physical processes that dictate
the initiation and dissipation of convective storms are not necessarily
observable in the past history of a particular echo development;
rather, they are often controlled by boundary layer convergence features,
environmental vertical wind shear, and buoyancy. Thus, successful
forecasts of storm initiation depend on accurate specification of
the initial thermodynamic and kinematic fields with particular attention
to convergence lines. For these reasons the ability to improve on
simple extrapolation techniques had stagnated until the present national
observational network modernization program. The ability to observe
small-scale boundary layer convergence lines is now possible with
operational Doppler radars and satellite imagery. In addition, it
has been demonstrated that high-resolution wind retrievals can be
obtained from single Doppler radar. Two methods are presently under
development for using these modern datasets to forecast thunderstorm
evolution: knowledge-based expert systems and numerical forecasting
models that are initialized with radar data. Both these methods are
very promising and progressing rapidly. Operational tests of expert
systems are presently taking place in the United Kingdom and in the
United States.},

In 1986, the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) developed a Hailstorm Intensity Scale to characterise around 2500 hailstorms known to have occurred in Great Britain since the first documented hailstorm event of 1141 AD. The most intense British hailstorm reached intensity H8 on the TORRO international scale which extends from intensities H0 to H10. This paper focuses on over 800 hailstorms that reached TORRO intensity of H3 or more, the “severe” category. Analyses are presented for the historical period and the most recent 50-year period, 1950 to 1999. Consideration is given to examining the 50 most intense hailstorms (TORRO intensity H5–6 or more) known to have occurred in Britain since 1650. These storms all occurred between the months of May and September with a well-defined peak during July. These exceptional storms typically followed a track from the S, SSW or SW to the N, NNE or NE with a swath length of 25 km or more (reaching 335 km in one case) and a swath width sometimes in excess of 10 km.},

Results are given for the frequency of hailstorm occurrence, characteristics of hailfalls at a point, hail paths, types of storms, radar characteristics and hailstone trajectories. Practically all features showed great variability, the magnitude of which is given whenever possible. Application of the results to the design of a hail suppression experiment is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {The annual cycle, annual and seasonal frequency and geographical distribution of hail in Argentina during the 1960-2008 period are examined. Eight regions covering the whole territory were defined based on the correlation of the mean annual hail frequency between all weather stations. Regions lying between 30?? and 40??S as well as those dominated by mountains present the highest hail frequencies in Argentina. The eastern and coastal areas of the country experience hail events mainly during springtime but they may start in late winter and continue through the beginning of summer. Events in western and central Argentina also predominate in spring but the maximum frequencies are observed during summer months. Trends in the annual number of hail events calculated for each region indicate that events in northwestern and northeastern Argentina have been increasing as well as in southern Patagonia. On the other hand, in central Argentina, southern Buenos Aires-La Pampa, northern Buenos Aires-Litoral and northern Patagonia trends are negative and statistically significant in the first two regions, basically by the decrease of events during spring and summer. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Numerous hailstorms are also estimated in the central and southeastern United States, northern Pakistan and northwestern India, central and western Africa, and southeastern Africa (and adjacent waters). Fewer hailstorms are estimated for other regions over land and scattered across subtropical oceans. Very few are estimated in the deep tropics other than in Africa.

Good agreement with measurements of SF6 tracer is reported in three case studies. Released in upwind valleys, the tracer movement and dispersion are strongly influenced by both valley flow and gravity waves excited by the mountains, as well as by changes in the synoptic flow, which can change substantially even during a single storm. The interaction between the airflow and the topography seem to be the dominant factor determining the dispersion and transport of tracer material.},

and oligoethylene glycols, as well as published data for organic
compounds. We compare predictions of CCN activity using water activities
based on Raoult's law and Flory-Huggins theory to observations. The
Flory-Huggins water activity expression, with an assumed surface
tension of pure water, generally predicts CCN activity within a factor
of two over the full range of molar volumes considered. CCN activity
is only weakly dependent on molar volume for values exceeding 600
cm3 mol, and the diminishing sensitivity to molar volume, combined
with the significant scatter in the data, limits the accuracy with
which molar volume can be inferred from CCN measurements.},

Aboard this aircraft was a Particle Concentrator-Brigham Young University Organic Sampling System (PC-BOSS), which was used to determine semivolatile particulate material with a diffusion denuder sampler. Denuded quartz filters and sorbent beds in series were used to measure nonvolatile and semivolatile materials, respectively. Results obtained with the PC-BOSS are compared to those obtained with conventional quartz-quartz and Teflon-quartz filter pack samplers. Various 10-120 min integrated samples were collected during flights through the h e troposphere, in the atmospheric boundary layer, and in plumes from savanna fires. Significant fine particulate semivolatile organic compounds (SVOC) were found in all samples. The SVOC was not collected by conventional filter pack samplers and therefore would not have been determined in previous studies that used only filter pack samplers. The SVOC averaged 24{\%} of the fine particulate mass in emissions from the fires and 36{\%} of the fine particulate mass in boundary layer samples heavily impacted by aged emissions from savanna fires. Concentrations of fine particulate material in the atmospheric mixed layer heavily impacted by aged savanna frre emissions averaged 130 micrograms per cubic meter. This aerosol was 85{\%} carbonaceous mated.},

abstract = {Advances in satellite sensors have provided new datasets for monitoringairquality at urban and regional scales. Qualitative true color images and quantitative aerosol optical depth data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on the Terra satellite were compared with ground-based particulate matter data from US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitoring networks covering the period from 1 April to 30 September, 2002. Using both imagery and statistical analysis, satellite data enabled the determination of the regional sources of air pollution events, the general type of pollutant (smoke, haze, dust), the intensity of the events, and their motion. Very high and very low aerosol optical depths were found to be eliminated by the algorithm used to calculate the MODIS aerosol optical depth data. Correlations of MODIS aerosol optical depth with ground-based particulate matter were better in the eastern and Midwest portion of the United States (east of 100°W). Data were patchy and had poorer correlations in the western US, although the correlation was dependent on location. This variability is likely due to a combination of the differences between ground-based and column average datasets, regression artifacts, variability of terrain, and MODIS cloud mask and aerosol optical depth algorithms. Preliminary analysis of the algorithms indicated that aerosol optical depth measurements calculated from the sulfate-rich aerosol model may be more useful in predicting ground-based particulate matter levels, but further analysis would be required to verify the effect of the model on correlations. Overall, the use of satellite sensor data such as from MODIS has significant potential to enhance airqualitymonitoring over synoptic and regional scales.},

abstract = {Cumulus cloud merging is a complex dynamical and microphysical process in which two convective cells merge into a single cell. Previous radar observations and numerical simulations have shown a substantial increase in the maximum area, maximum echo top and maximum reflectivity as a result of the merging process. Although the qualitative aspects of merging have been well documented, the quantitative effects on storm properties remain less defined. Therefore, a statistical assessment of changes in storm characteristics due to merging is of importance. Further investigation into the effects of cloud merging on precipitation flux (Pflux) in a statistical manner provided the motivation for this study in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia. It was confirmed that merging has a strong effect on storm development in this region. The data analysis shows that an increase in the median of the distribution of maximum reflectivity was observed just after merging and was equal to 3.9. dBZ. A detailed analysis of the individual merge cases compared the merged storm Pflux and mass to the sum of the individual Feeder and Storm portions just before merging for each case. The merged storm Pflux increased an average of 106{\%} over the 20-min period after merging, and the mass increased on average 143{\%}. The merged storm clearly became larger and more severe than the sum of the two parts prior to merging. One consequence of this study is that any attempts to evaluate the precipitation enhancement effects of cloud seeding must also include the issue of cloud mergers because merging can have a significant effect on the results. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We measured stable and reactive trace gases with an airborne Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (AFTIR) on the University of Washington Convair-580 research aircraft in August/September 2000 during the SAFARI 2000 dry season campaign in Southern Africa. The measurements included vertical profiles of C02, CO, H20, and CH4 up to 5.5 km on six occasions above instrumented ground sites and below the TERRA satellite and ER-2 high-flying research aircraft. We also measured the trace gas emissions from 10 African savanna fires. Five of these fires featured extensive ground-based fuel characterization, and two were in the humid savanna ecosystem that accounts for most African biomass burning. The major constituents we detected in nascent CH3OOH, HCHO, CH30H, HCN, NH3, HCOOH, and C2H2. These are the first quantitative measurements of the initial emissions of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOC), NH3, and HCN from African savanna fires. On average, we measured 5.3 g/kg of OVOC and 3.6 g/kg of hydrocarbons (including CH4) in the initial emissions from the fires. Thus, the OVOC will have profound, largely unexplored effects on tropical tropospheric chemistry. The HCN emission factor was only weakly dependent on fire type; the average value (0.53 g/kg) is about 20 times that of a previous recommendation. HCN may be useful as a tracer for savanna fires. Delta O3/Delta CO and Delta CH3COO/Delta CO increased to as much as 9{\%} in {\textless}1 h of photochemical processing downwind of fires. Direct measurements showed that cloud processing of smoke greatly reduced CH30H, NH3, CH3COOH, SO2, and NO2 levels, but significantly increased HCHO and NO.},

As a result, a more spatially detailed analysis is now possible. Unfortunately, after 1993 the observing network began to be replaced by automatic stations that do not report hail, and therefore a mesoscale analysis can only effectively use the time period of 1977-1993. Due to the fact that ice pellets have often been recorded as hail, this analysis restricted itself to the warm months of May to September. The current national hail climatology is broadly similar to the previous one (with a few notable differences) but is much richer in spatial detail. The highest hail frequencies occur in interior British Columbia and Alberta. Topography appears to be a significant control on patterns of hail occurrence.},

abstract = {It has been long understood that the partly cloudy atmosphere manifests
a continuum of states between the end members `clear' and `cloud.'
Nevertheless, many research methods are premised on a dichotomy of
states{\&}{\#}8212;for example, those that use `cloud cover' or `cloud-clearing.'
Here we consider the consequences of this practice for studies of
aerosol-climate effects. Aerosols affect the Earth's energy budget
primarily by affecting albedo; therefore, we explore the nature of
albedo variability in the partly cloudy marine boundary layer on
scales down to a few tens of metres. We employ two diagnostic tools:
a cloud resolving model and an albedo proxy derived from high altitude
lidars. We show that a continuum of albedo values results from indeterminate
and variable combinations of hydrated aerosol and wispy (including
subvisible) clouds. Two consequences arise. First, cloud-clearing
schemes employed by different observational methods are mutually
inconsistent and are sensitive to concentrations of unactivated aerosol
particles. Second, aerosol radiative forcing (the sensitivity of
overall albedo to changes in aerosol concentration) is inaccurately
calculated as the average},

The improvements in the urban thermal environment via the various measures were analyzed for two types of scenarios, namely, scenarios related to the management of heat discharge sources and urban surface modifications. The maximum improvement in average temperature for daytime was found to be 0.47°C (at noon) as a result of greening the areas around the buildings of Tokyo. Similarly, the maximum improvement in average temperature for the evening was found to be 0.11°C by discharging all heat to the ground.},

In this article, we review the major developments and climatological applications of SOMs in the literature. The SOM can be used in synoptic climatological analysis in a manner similar to most other clustering methods. However, as the results from a SOM are generally represented by a two-dimensional array of cluster types that ‘self-organize', the synoptic categories in the array effectively represent a continuum of synoptic categorizations, compared with discrete realizations produced through most traditional methods. Thus, a larger number of patterns can be more readily understood, and patterns, as well as transitional nodes between patterns, can be discerned. Perhaps the most intriguing development with SOMs has been the new avenues of visualization; the resultant spatial patterns of any variable can be more readily understood when displayed in a SOM. This improved visualization has led to SOMs becoming an increasingly popular tool in various research with climatological applications from other disciplines as well.},

abstract = {Atmospheric mercury is predominantly present in the gaseous elemental form (Hg0). However, anthropogenic emissions (e.g., incineration, fossil fuel combustion) emit and natural processes create particulate-phase mercury(Hg(p)) and divalent reactive gas-phase mercury (RGM). RGM species (e.g., HgCl2, HgBr2) are water-soluble and have much shorter residence times in the atmosphere than Hg0 due to their higher removal rates through wet and dry deposition mechanisms. Manual and automated annular denuder methodologies, to provide high-resolution (1-2 h) ambient RGM measurements, were developed and evaluated. Following collection of RGM onto KCl-coated quartz annular denuders, RGM was thermally decomposed and quantified as Hg0. Laboratory and field evaluations of the denuders found the RGM collection efficiency to be {\textgreater}94{\%} and mean collocated precision to be {\textless}15{\%}. Method detection limits for sampling durations ranging from 1 to 12 h were 6.2-0.5 pg m(-3), respectively. As part of this research, the authors observed that methods to measure Hg(p) had a significant positive artifact when RGM coexists with Hg(p). This artifact was eliminated if a KCl-coated annular denuder preceded the filter. This new atmospheric mercury speciation methodology has dramatically enhanced our ability to investigate the mechanisms of transformation and deposition of mercury in the atmosphere.},

abstract = {Objectives. To estimate the burden of respiratory ill health in South African children and adults in 2000 from exposure to indoor air pollution associated with household use of solid fuels. Design. World Health Organization comparative risk assessment (CRA) methodology was followed. The South African Census 2001 was used to derive the proportion of households using solid fuels for cooking and heating by population group. Exposure estimates were adjusted by a ventilation factor taking into account the general level of ventilation in the households. Population-attributable fractions were calculated and applied to revised burden of disease estimates for each population group. Monte Carlo simulation-modelling techniques were used for uncertainty analysis. Setting. South Africa. Subjects. Black African, coloured, white and Indian children under 5 years of age and adults aged 30 years and older. Outcome measures. Mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from acute lower respiratory infections in children under 5 years, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer in adults 30 years and older. Results. An estimated 20{\%} of South African households were exposed to indoor smoke from solid fuels, with marked variation by population group. This exposure was estimated to have caused 2 489 deaths (95{\%} uncertainty interval 1 672 - 3 324) or 0.5{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval 0.3 - 0.6{\%}) of all deaths in South Africa in 2000. The loss of healthy life years comprised a slightly smaller proportion of the total: 60 934 DALYs (95{\%} uncertainty interval 41 170 - 81 246) or 0.4{\%} of all DALYs (95{\%} uncertainty interval 0.3 - 0.5{\%}) in South Africa in 2000. Almost 99{\%} of this burden occurred in the black African population. Conclusions. The most important interventions to reduce this impact include access to cleaner household fuels, improved stoves, and better ventilation.

@article{thunis_1996,
abstract = {The present research proposes a standard nomenclature for mesoscale meteorological concepts and integrates existing concepts of atmospheric space scales, flow assumptions, governing equations, and resulting motions into a hierarchy useful in categorization of mesoscale models. New dynamically based mesoscale time- and space-scale boundaries are proposed, consistent with the importance of the Coriolis force. In the proposed flow-class classification, the starting point is the complete (no approximations) set of mesoscale equations for non-Boussinesq flows. In the subsequent scale analysis. the deep and shallow Boussinesq flow divisions of Dutton and Fichtl are kept, as is the shallow-flow subdivisions of Mahrt In addition, the scale analysis approach of Mahrt is extended to deep Boussinesq motions. Limits of applicability of each derived flow-class equation set (with respect to atmospheric phenomena that can be simulated) are also discussed.The proposed hierarchy of atmospheric motions is organized into hydrostatic versus nonhydrostatic flow types and then into non-Boussinesq, deep, and shallow Boussinesq motions. Criteria used to differentiate each resulting flow class are discussed, while resulting governing thermodynamic and dynamic equations for each motion type are given. Separate graphical representations during stable and unstable conditions of the spatial limits of each Boussinesq mesoscale flow subclass are constructed from order of magnitude estimates for the various length and flow-class separation criteria. A summary of the consensus in the literature concerning the equation sets necessary to reproduce characteristics associated with specific atmospheric flow phenomenon is given. Comparative modeling studies are required to test the quantitative aspects of many of the ideas put forth in this paper.},

abstract = {Communication of the complex relationship between air pollutant exposure and ill health is essential to an air pollution information system. We propose a novel air pollution index (API) system based on the relative risk of the well-established increased daily mortality associated with short-term exposure to common air pollutants: particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), sulphur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. To construct our index system, the total incremental daily mortality risk of exposure to these pollutants was associated with an index value ranging from 0 to 10. The index scale is linear with respect to incremental risk. The index is open ended, although, for convenience, an index of 10 is assigned for exposures yielding indices ???10. To illustrate the application of this API system, a set of published relative risk factors are used to calculate sub-index values for each pollutant, in the range of air pollutant concentrations commonly experienced in urban areas. To account for the reality of ubiquitous simultaneous exposure to a mixture of the common air pollutants, the final API is the sum of the normalised values of the individual indices for PM10, PM2.5, sulphur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. This establishes a self-consistent index system where a given index value corresponds to the same daily mortality risk associated with the combined exposure to the common air pollutants. To facilitate health-risk communication, index values are colour coded and associated with broad health-risk descriptors. The utility of the proposed API is illustrated by applying it to monitored ambient concentration data for the City of Cape Town, South Africa. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the validation of radar rainfall measurement
in a mountainous region by comparison with raingage data. Initially,
the comparison serves as a basis for defining the assessment factor
introduced to correct the systematic bias often affecting radar data.
Several methods are available for determining the assessment factor
and all are shown to provide a similar result. Corrections for both
beam blockage and vertical profile of reflectivity are also evaluated.
Both corrections provide an improvement in radar measurement accuracy.
The validation of radar rainfall measurement is performed at the
catchment scale of a few hundred square kilometres and at an hourly
time period, these conditions being consistent with hydrological
needs. The reference rainfall is determined by interpolating data
from a dense raingage network. The accuracy of the areal reference
value is defined by its standard deviation. A validation criterion
taking into account the accuracy of the reference value is introduced.
Validation results show a good level of agreement between reference
measurements and radar data at the catchment scale. The confidence
associated with the reference value suggests a combined use of radar
and raingages based on the control of radar estimates by raingage
measurements. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

We present APHENA results on the effects of particulate matter (PM) {\textless} or = 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10)) on the daily number of deaths for all ages and for those {\textless} 75 and {\textgreater} or = 75 years of age. We explored the impact of potential environmental and socioeconomic factors that may modify this association.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In the first stage of a two-stage analysis, we used Poisson regression models, with natural and penalized splines, to adjust for seasonality, with various degrees of freedom. In the second stage, we used meta-regression approaches to combine time-series results across cites and to assess effect modification by selected ecologic covariates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Air pollution risk estimates were relatively robust to different modeling approaches. Risk estimates from Europe and United States were similar, but those from Canada were substantially higher. The combined effect of PM(10) on all-cause mortality across all ages for cities with daily air pollution data ranged from 0.2{\%} to 0.6{\%} for a 10-microg/m(3) increase in ambient PM(10) concentration. Effect modification by other pollutants and climatic variables differed in Europe and the United States. In both of these regions, a higher proportion of older people and higher unemployment were associated with increased air pollution risk.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Estimates of the increased mortality associated with PM air pollution based on the APHENA study were generally comparable with results of previous reports. Overall, risk estimates were similar in Europe and in the United States but higher in Canada. However, PM(10) effect modification patterns were somewhat different in Europe and the United States.},

Evaluation of these models for emissions from quarries/open pit mines that are located in complex topography is missing from the literature. Due to severe uncertainties in the input parameters, numerous scenarios were simulated and model sensitivity was studied. Model results were compared among themselves, and to measured total suspended particulate (TSP). For a wide range of meteorological and topographical conditions studied, AERMOD predictions were in a better agreement with the measurements than those obtained by CALPUFF. The use of AERMOD's "Open pit" tool seems unnecessary when accurate digital topographic data are available. Onsite meteorological data are shown to be crucial for reliable dispersion calculations in complex terrain. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {1 We collected filter samples of the atmospheric aerosol during the Southern African Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI 2000) experiment onboard the UK Met Office C-130 aircraft. The main operational area was the Atlantic Ocean offshore of Namibia and Angola, where biomass-smoke haze at least 1-2 days old was widespread. The size-fractionated aerosol samples were analyzed for the major inorganic ions, carbonaceous material (elemental and organic carbon), and elements with atomic numbers between 11 (Na) and 82 (Pb). The regional haze aerosol was composed mostly of carbonaceous aerosols (on the average, 81{\%} of the submicron mass), with secondary inorganic aerosols (sulfate, ammonium, and nitrate) accounting for another 14{\%}. K+ and Cl-, typical pyrogenic species, constituted only 2{\%} of the mass. The aerosol chemical data were used to estimate mass emission fluxes for various aerosol components. For African savanna/grassland burning, the estimated emission flux of carbonaceous particles (particulate organic matter plus elemental carbon) is 14 1 Tg yr(-1), and that of the nitrogen species (nitrate and ammonium) is 2 2 Tg yr(-1). For the flight segments in regional haze, the mean particle scattering coefficient at 550 nm was sigma(s) = 101 56 Mm(-1) and the mean particle absorption coefficients a at 565 nm averaged 8 5 Mm(-1) (mean single scattering albedo of 0.93 0.06 at 550 nm). The dry mass scattering efficiency alpha(s), calculated from the linear regression of the mean scattering versus the estimated submicron mass, is estimated to be between 4.2 and 4.6 0.6 m(2) g(-1), depending on the assumptions made in calculating the aerosol mass. The dependence of the scattering enhancement ratios Deltasigma(s)/DeltaCO on the distance from the burning regions suggests that the evolution of particle size with time influences the light scattering efficiency. Fresh smoke was sampled during a dedicated flight in the proximity and within the plume of an active biomass burning fire. Here the enhancement ratio with respect to CO of particles in the Aitken-size range (5-100 nm diameter) was DeltaN(Aitken)/DeltaCO similar to25 cm(-3) (STP) ppb(-1). These particles were removed rapidly after emission, and they were not detectable in the regional haze. The enhancement ratio for accumulation mode particles (0.1-1 mm diameter) DeltaN(Acc)/DeltaCO was similar to26-30 cm(-3) (STP) ppb(-1) in young smoke, and 16 3 cm(-3) (STP) ppb(-1) in aged haze, suggesting that the number concentration of accumulation mode particles was reduced by about 41{\%} during aging.},

abstract = {A new tuning-free subgrid-scale model, termed `locally-averaged scale-dependent dynamic' (LASDD) model, is developed and implemented in large-eddy simulations (LESs) of stable boundary layers. The new model dynamically computes the Smagorinsky coefficient and the subgrid-scale Prandtl number based on the local dynamics of the resolved velocity and temperature fields. Overall, the agreement between the statistics of the LES-generated turbulence and some well-established empirical formulations and theoretical predictions (e.g., Nieuwstadt's local scaling hypothesis) is remarkable. The results show clear improvements over most of the traditional subgrid-scale models in the surface layer. Moreover, in contrast to previous large-eddy simulations of stable boundary layers that have strong dependence on grid resolution, the simulated statistics obtained with the LASDD model show relatively little resolution dependence for the range of grid sizes considered here. In essence, we show that the new LASDD model is a robust subgrid-scale parameterization for reliable, tuning-free simulations of stable boundary layers, even with relatively coarse resolutions.},

The lateral separation between the Electra in the center, and the other two aircraft was ≈30 m. One sensing system utilized constrained vanes and the other differential pressure measurements across ports on a nose radome to obtain the two airflow angles that are used to calculate the transverse air velocity components. Both systems used a Pitot-static pressure difference for obtaining the longitudinal velocity component. We compare differences in means and variances, spectra and cospectra, and spatial coherences between the same velocity components measured on the different aircraft.

abstract = {Estimation of the radar reflectivity from Local Area Weather Radars (LAWR) is investigated. Normally, the LAWR system operates with the Dimensionless Radar Output (DRO) instead of dBZ, because the absolute scaling to dBZ is unknown for the LAWR. A transformation methodology is proposed for LAWR DRO–dBZ conversion. The method applies dBZ observations from ground based disdrometers. The paper illustrates the possibility of establishing a direct relationship between the LAWR DRO estimates and the physical radar reflectivity of the precipitation. Also, rain intensity estimate from the LAWR system, by means of the Marshall–Palmer relation, is conducted nonlinearly from the DRO estimate. This diverges from prior investigations and applications of the LAWR system, which typically rely on a linear assumption between the rain intensity and the LAWR DRO.},

The city of Cape Town (South Africa) is at risk from projected climate-induced warming and changes in rainfall variability. This makes resource management and infrastructure planning more challenging and increases the urgency of the need to adapt city-level operations to both current climate variability and future climate change. To date, however, the main focus of adaptation planning has been at the national level, and has not adequately addressed municipal-scale adaptation. This paper presents and discusses an overarching framework that would facilitate the development of a Municipal Adaptation Plan (MAP). The example of the city of Cape Town illustrates some of the sector-level assessments and potential climate threats, as well as resource mobilization issues that need to be addressed during the development and implementation of a MAP.

abstract = {This work presents a theoretical model based on the electrostatic image charges method to calculate the steady-state water vapour density field for a population of supercooled cloud droplets and ice crystals. The model allows a determination of the vapour density among the cloud droplets and ice particles and obtains a representative vapour density of the system which is called the ambient vapour density of the mixed-phase cloud. The results show that the ambient vapour density is close to the saturated value over water in clouds where the cloud droplet concentration is much higher than the ice crystal concentration and close to the ice saturation value in glaciated clouds. A parameterization of the ambient vapour density is given as a function of the sizes and concentrations of the cloud droplets and ice crystals. In addition, the model is used to study the diffusional growth rate of ice crystals immersed in a mixed cloud. The results indicate that the growth of an ice crystal can be reduced by the presence of neighbouring crystals. A mass growth rate equation for diffusional growth was found, which incorporates effects of the ice crystal size, the cloud droplet radius, liquid water content, and ice crystal and droplet concentrations. These studies are of important to considerations in thunderstorm electrification processes, where the mechanism of charge transfer between colliding ice particles and graupel is influenced by growth rate. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The occurrence of environmental conditions favorable for severe convective storms was assessed in an ensemble of 14 regional climate models covering Europe and the Mediterranean with a horizontal grid spacing of 0.44°. These conditions included the collocated presence of latent instability and strong deep-layer (surface to 500 hPa) wind shear which is conducive to the severe and well-organized convective storms. The occurrence of precipitation in the models was used as a proxy for convective initiation. Two climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) were investigated by comparing two future periods (2021-2050 and 2071-2100) to a historical period (1971-2000) for each of these scenarios. The ensemble simulates a robust increase (change larger than twice the ensemble sample standard deviation) in the frequency of occurrence of unstable environments (Lifted Index ≤ -2) across central and south-central Europe in the RCP8.5 scenario in the late 21st century. This increase coincides with the increase in lower tropospheric moisture. Smaller, less robust changes were found until mid-century in the RCP8.5 scenario and in the RCP4.5 scenario. Changes in the frequency of situations with strong (≥ 15 m s-1) deep-layer shear were found to be small and not robust, except across far northern Europe, where a decrease in shear is projected. By the end of the century, the simultaneous occurrence of latent instability, strong deep-layer shear and model precipitation is simulated to increase by up to 100{\%} across central and eastern Europe in the RCP8.5 and by 30-50{\%} in the RCP4.5 scenario. Until mid-century, increases in the 10-25{\%} range are forecast for most regions. A large inter-model variability is present in the ensemble and is primarily due to the uncertainties in the frequency of the occurrence of unstable environments.},

@book{Ingold2000,
abstract = {In this work Tim Ingold offers a persuasive new approach to understanding how human beings perceive their surroundings. He argues that what we are used to calling cultural variation consists, in the first place, of variations in skill. Neither innate nor acquired, skills are grown, incorporated into the human organism through practice and training in an environment. They are thus as much biological as cultural. To account for the generation of skills we have therefore to understand the dynamics of development. And this in turn calls for an ecological approach that situates practitioners in the context of an active engagement with the constituents of their surroundings. The twenty-three essays comprising this book focus in turn on the procurement of livelihood, on what it means to dwell, and on the nature of skill, weaving together approaches from social anthropology, ecological psychology, developmental biology and phenomenology in a way that has never been attempted before. The book is set to revolutionise the way we think about what is biological and cultural in humans, about evolution and history, and indeed about what it means for human beings at once organisms and persons to inhabit an environment. The Perception of the Environment will be essential reading not only for anthropologists but also for biologists, psychologists, archaeologists, geographers and philosophers.},

@article{Kohler2014,
abstract = {By international standards the economy of South Africa is extremely energy intensive with only a few countries having higher intensities. SA's primary energy use per unit of GDP is amongst the highest in the world. The high energy and electricity intensity of the economy partly reflects SA's resource endowments (in particular the abundance of coal) but is also a function of the historical under-pricing of coal and electricity by the authorities. South African mining {\&} industrial electricity efficiency is particularly concerning and considerably lower than the global average. This paper sets out to fill a significant gap in the South African energy literature by highlighting the importance of incorporating electricity demand factors as part of the country's energy policy and electricity planning horizon. The paper focuses its attention on modelling the electricity consumption of SA's industrial and mining sectors given these account for the lion's share of electricity demand. A differential electricity pricing policy which targets electricity intensive industrial and mining activities (as practised in China since 2004) is viewed by the author to be a superior policy to blanket electricity price increases administered by authorities in an effort to encourage electricity savings and improve energy efficiency in South Africa. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this study we investigated sampling-related errors of tipping-bucket (TB) rain gauge measurements, focusing on the gauge's ability to represent the small-scale rainfall temporal variability. We employed a simple TB simulator that used ultra-high-resolution measurements from an experimental optical rain gauge. The simulated observations were used to provide TB rain rate estimates on time scales as low as one minute. The simulation results showed that the TB estimates suffer from significant errors if based on time scales less than 10 to 15 minutes. We provide the approximate formulas used to characterize the TB sampling errors at several time scales. Our results show the importance of using fine resolution of both the sampling time interval and the bucket size so that the TB rain rate estimates have minimum levels of uncertainty.},

abstract = {This paper examines air pollution situation and the history of air quality management in Botswana. The current air quality man- agement in Botswana is still largely underpinned by the Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act of 1971, supplemented by the more recently enacted legislations such as the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act of 2010 and the Ambient Air Quality - Limits for Common Pollutants of 2012 published by the Botswana Bureau of Standards. Though commendable efforts have been made toward legislating against air and other forms of pollution, these have not yielded expected results in view of the prevailing levels of air pollutants like sulphur dioxide and fine particulate matters in the country's atmospheric environment. Legislation as a sole measure may not be effective in tackling this challenge. Rather, government should also address some root-causes of the problem by making policies and programmes that will reduce unemployment and increase the earning capacity of citizenry. This will, among other things, effectively check poverty-induced biomass burning in the country. The paper looks at some other challenges of air pollution manage- ment and suggestions are made to tackle the identified problems. Keywords},

@article{Bradshaw2010,
abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between global energy security and climate change policy. There are growing concerns about the sustainability of the future supply of hydrocarbons. The energy system is the single largest source of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, therefore it is no surprise that decarbonising the supply of energy services is a key element of climate change policy. The central proposition of this paper is that the world faces a global energy dilemma: can we have secure, reliable and affordable supplies of energy and, at the same time, manage the transition to a low-carbon energy system? The paper is divided into five sections. The first section considers the contemporary challenges to global energy security, focusing on the possibility that in the future oil production might not be able to meet demand. The second section considers how the perils of climate change are forcing us to rethink the very meaning of energy security such that a low-carbon energy revolution is now called for. The third section explains that while the developed world is largely responsible for the anthropogenic carbon emissions currently in the atmosphere, a global shift in energy demand is underway and over the next 20 years it is the developing world that will contribute an ever-increasing share of global emissions. The fourth section introduces the notion of the global energy dilemma nexus to explain how the processes of globalisation are the driving force behind this global shift in energy demand and carbon emissions. The final section explains how the global energy dilemma nexus plays itself out in different ways across the globe. The conclusions suggest that human geography can make a significant contribution to social science research on energy security and climate change.},

abstract = {Online journals promise to serve more information to more dispersed
audiences and are more efficiently searched and recalled. But because
they are used differently than print--scientists and scholars tend
to search electronically and follow hyperlinks rather than browse
or peruse--electronically available journals may portend an ironic
change for science. Using a database of 34 million articles, their
citations (1945 to 2005), and online availability (1998 to 2005),
I show that as more journal issues came online, the articles referenced
tended to be more recent, fewer journals and articles were cited,
and more of those citations were to fewer journals and articles.
The forced browsing of print archives may have stretched scientists
and scholars to anchor findings deeply into past and present scholarship.
Searching online is more efficient and following hyperlinks quickly
puts researchers in touch with prevailing opinion, but this may accelerate
consensus and narrow the range of findings and ideas built upon.

abstract = {Corporate social responsibility has received an increasing amount of attention from practitioners and scholars alike in recent years. However, very little is known about whether or how corporate social responsibility affects employees. Because employees are primary stakeholders who directly contribute to the success of the company, understanding employee reactions to corporate social responsibility may help answer lingering questions about the potential effects of corporate social responsibility on firms as well as illuminate some of the processes responsible for them. To begin our chapter, we provide a brief history of scholarship on corporate social responsibility and highlight some of the major challenges researchers in this area currently face. We then discuss why corporate social responsibility may represent a special opportunity to influence employees' general impression of their company. Next, we identify four distinct paths through which corporate social responsibility may affect employees' relationship with their company that correspond to four universal psychological needs: security, self-esteem, belongingness, and a meaningful existence. Finally, we offer an agenda for micro-level research on corporate social responsibility. Contents},

abstract = {Accurate representation of the physical and biological features of the landscape within the watershed is required as the extent and type of watershed cover affects the movement of water in the hydrologic cycle. Remote sensing (RS), such as satellite imagery from Landsat and other satellites, provides land-cover and surface microclimate information with high temporal and spatial accuracy. The use of these data to understand hydrologic processes depends on how accurately they are interpreted and mapped. A study conducted at the Heart River sub-basin in the Missouri River basin, located on southwestern North Dakota, utilizes Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery and geographic information system (GIS) tools to derive land- cover for the summer of 2002. Land surface temperature and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Landsat image was used to better map the land-cover and estimate runoff response. The corresponding infiltration excess runoff response of the study area was estimated using the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service Curve Number (USDA-NRCS-CN) method. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM)-RS-GIS routing technique based on a 1-D kinematic wave approximation was developed to predict stream response to runoff events based on the travel time from each grid cell to the watershed outlet. Simulated and observed runoff volume and hydrographs were compared for three storm events. The NRCS-CN method with the DEM-RS-GIS routing technique predicts the observed runoff volume with mean error and residual standard deviation of (38{\%} and 5 mm), peak flow (-15{\%} and 2.38 m3 and, 1.26 day), respectively},

abstract = {Aerosols affect the Earth's energy budget directly by scattering and absorbing radiation and indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei and, thereby, affecting cloud properties. However, large uncertainties exist in current estimates of aerosol forcing because of incomplete knowledge concerning the distribution and the physical and chemical properties of aerosols as well as aerosol-cloud interactions. In recent years, a great deal of effort has gone into improving measurements and datasets. It is thus feasible to shift the estimates of aerosol forcing from largely model-based to increasingly measurement-based. Our goal is to assess current observational capabilities and identify uncertainties in the aerosol direct forcing through comparisons of different methods with independent sources of uncertainties. Here we assess the aerosol optical depth (tau), direct radiative effect (DRE) by natural and anthropogenic aerosols, and direct climate forcing (DCF) by anthropogenic aerosols, focusing on satellite and ground-based measurements supplemented by global chemical transport model CTM) simulations. The multi-spectral MODIS measures global distributions of aerosol optical depth (tau) on a daily scale, with a high accuracy of 0.03 0.05 tau over ocean. The annual average tau is about 0.14 over global ocean, of which about 21{\%} 7{\%} is contributed by human activities, as estimated by MODIS fine-mode fraction. The multi-angle MISR derives an annual average AOD of 0.23 over global land with an uncertainty of similar to 20{\%} or 0.05. These high-accuracy aerosol products and broadband flux measurements from CERES make it feasible to obtain observational constraints for the aerosol direct effect, especially over global the ocean. A number of measurement-based approaches estimate the clear-sky DRE on solar radiation) at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) to be about - 5.5 0.2 W m(-2) median standard error from various methods) over the global ocean. Accounting for thin cirrus contamination of the satellite derived aerosol field will reduce the TOA DRE to -5.0 W m(-2). Because of a lack of measurements of aerosol absorption and difficulty in characterizing land surface reflection, estimates of DRE over land and at the ocean surface are currently realized through a combination of satellite retrievals, surface measurements, and model simulations, and are less constrained. Over the oceans the surface DRE is estimated to be - 8.8 0.7W m(-2). Over land, an integration of satellite retrievals and model simulations derives a DRE of - 4.9 0.7W m(-2) and - 11.8 1.9W m(-2) at the TOA and surface, respectively. CTM simulations derive a wide range of DRE estimates that on average are smaller than the measurement-based DRE by about 30 - 40{\%}, even after accounting for thin cirrus and cloud contamination. A number of issues remain. Current estimates of the aerosol direct effect over land are poorly constrained. Uncertainties of DRE estimates are also larger on regional scales than on a global scale and large discrepancies exist between different approaches. The characterization of aerosol absorption and vertical distribution remains challenging. The aerosol direct effect in the thermal infrared range and in cloudy conditions remains relatively unexplored and quite uncertain, because of a lack of global systematic aerosol vertical profile measurements. A coordinated research strategy needs to be developed for integration and assimilation of satellite measurements into models to constrain model simulations. Enhanced measurement capabilities in the next few years and high-level scientific cooperation will further advance our knowledge.},

The experiments were carried out in a cloud chamber at the$\backslash$nconditions corresponding to the formation of convective clouds. The$\backslash$nresults have shown that the introduction of the salt powder before a$\backslash$ncloud medium is formed in the chamber results in the formation on a$\backslash$n`tail' of additional large drops. In this case seeding with the salt$\backslash$npowder leads also to enlargement of the whole population of cloud drops$\backslash$nand to a decrease of their total concentration as compared to a cloud$\backslash$nmedium that is formed on background aerosols. These results are the$\backslash$npositive factors for stimulating coagulation processes in clouds and for$\backslash$nsubsequent formation of precipitation in them. An overseeding effect,$\backslash$nwhich is characterized by increased droplet concentration and decreased$\backslash$ndroplet size, was not observed even at high salt powder concentrations.$\backslash$nThe results of numerical simulations have shown that the transformation$\backslash$nof cloud drop spectra induced by the introduction of the salt powder$\backslash$nresults in more intense coagulation processes in clouds as compared to$\backslash$nthe case of cloud modification with hygroscopic particles with$\backslash$nrelatively narrow particle size distributions, and for the distribution$\backslash$nof the South African hygroscopic flares.

The ratio of sigma(sub sp) at an RH of 80{\%} to that at 30{\%} provides a measure of the effects of RH on sigma(sub sp), and similarly for Beta(1). For the three broad sampling categories given above, and at a wavelength of 550 nm, these ratios varied from 1.42 0.05 to 2.07 0.03 for sigma(sub sp), and from 0.69 0.05 to 0.99 0.14 for Beta(1). In general, humidographs for the ambient air samples showed a greater dependence on RH than those for smoke from identifiable biomass fires. During a period when dense, aged smoke was transported to the region from the north, the humidographs for sigma(sub sp) for ambient air samples were similar to those for identifiable smoke plume samples just approximately 10- to 50-min old. This suggests that as far as the effects of RH on sigma(sub sp) are concerned the effects of aging of smoke and its mixing with ambient air are realized within less than about an hour.},

abstract = {Increased  concentrations of ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) since preindustrial times reflect increased emissions, but also contributions of past climate change. Here we use modeled concentrations from an ensemble of chemistry–climate models to estimate the global burden of anthropogenic outdoor air pollution on present-day premature human mortality, and the component of that burden attributable to past climate change. Using simulated concentrations for 2000 and 1850 and concentration–response functions (CRFs), we estimate that, at present, 470 000 (95{\%} confidence interval, 140 000 to 900 000) premature respiratory deaths are associated globally and annually with anthropogenic ozone, and 2.1 (1.3 to 3.0) million deaths with anthropogenic PM2.5-related cardiopulmonary diseases (93{\%}) and lung cancer (7{\%}). These estimates are smaller than ones from previous studies because we use modeled 1850 air pollution rather than a counterfactual low concentration, and because of different emissions. Uncertainty in CRFs contributes more to overall uncertainty than the spread of model results. Mortality attributed to the effects of past climate change on air quality is considerably smaller than the global burden: 1500 (−20 000 to 27 000) deaths yr−1 due to ozone and 2200 (−350 000 to 140 000) due to PM2.5. The small multi-model means are coincidental, as there are larger ranges  of results for individual models, reflected in the large uncertainties, with some models suggesting that past climate change has reduced air pollution mortality.},

Association of the circulation patterns to the local climate is investigated using observed daily temperature and rainfall data at 27 locations over Saudi Arabia for the period 1979-2010. Using the widely-used mathematical technique principal component analysis (PCA) we determine with MSLP data the principal patterns. We only analyse data for the wet season (October-May). The automated typing procedure establishes 12 circulation types, which represent all the main synoptic features especially those that originate from the Mediterranean, the European and African continents, Siberia, and also the Red and Arabian seas. There is a strong link between the circulation types and surface climate that is synoptically and spatially interpretable. Particular circulation types are associated with specific climatic conditions across the country: rainfall is linked with Types 9, 10 and 11, whilst warm days (nights) with 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11 and 12 (1, 2, 3, 10, 11 and 12), and cold days (nights) with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11 and 12 (2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). In terms of regional influences, the circulation types also exhibit specific links between certain types and climatic divisions across Saudi Arabia.},

CRMs are being used increasingly for high-resolution operational numerical weather prediction and for research purposes. We report on the development of a new CRM in South Africa. Two bulk microphysics parameterisation schemes were introduced to a dynamical core of a two-dimensional Non-hydrostatic $\sigma$-coordinate Model (NSM) developed in South Africa. The resulting CRM was used to simulate two 12-day periods and an 8-day period observed during the Tropical Oceans Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment. The response of the NSM to the large-scale forcing which occurred over the three periods, and which included both suppressed and active convection, was examined. The NSM is shown to be able to capture the differences in the three experiments and responds correctly to the large-scale forcing (i.e. it is able to distinguish between suppressed and active regimes). However, the model simulations are cooler and drier than the observations. We demonstrate progress made in the development of a CRM in South Africa, which can be used to study the attributes of convective rainfall over the region.},

abstract = {1 The statistical problem of comparing rain gauge measurements to satellite rain-rate estimates over an area surrounding the gauge(s) is examined using a model of rainfall variability developed for studies of sampling error in averages of satellite data. The model is able to capture a number of important aspects of the space-time spectrum of rain-rate variability, including the interdependence of time and space scales of variability. Four parameters must be specified in the model. Sets of parameters have been obtained that fit the statistics of radar-derived rain rates over the eastern tropical Atlantic (from GATE) and the western tropical Pacific (from TOGA COARE). The model predicts that there is an optimal averaging time for gauge data when gauge averages are compared to average satellite rain-rates for a specified area around the gauge. The optimal averaging time ranges from minutes to days as the diameter of the area around the gauge is extended from 2 km to 200 km. The optimal averaging time shrinks as more gauges are added to the area viewed by the satellite, but the model suggests that even over fairly dense gauge networks it is necessary to compare averages of several hundred satellite overflights in order to bring the comparison error down to the 10{\%} level. The possibility that comparisons of gauge data with satellite averages might be improved by weighting the gauge data differently depending on how close the gauge data are in time to the satellite overflights is investigated, and it is found that in some cases the variance of the comparison error can be reduced by a factor of two by using optimal time-dependent weighting.},

@article{Sanchez2013,
abstract = {The detection of hail precipitation generated by a storm is a complicated task due to the limited spatial extension and the space-time irregularity of impacts generated on the ground. Some of the most extensive methods to create climatology of these impacts are observer networks or hailpad networks. Both methods are affected by numerous inconveniences, overall when it is necessary to work with an extensive area, in which it is necessary to maintain an operating network that has numerous maintenance costs. In this sense, there are numerous works done that have developed different models with the objective of detecting hail precipitation using meteorological radar. Some of these methods use discriminant statistic techniques that, through the combination of different radar parameters, can achieve very satisfactory results. On the other hand, it would be very interesting to know not only the probability of hail, but also some of the characteristics of the hailstones precipitated, such as the number or their kinetic energy, since these parameters are directly related to the damage generated in infrastructures and/or crops. The estimation of kinetic energy of hail precipitation using meteorological radar has caught the interest of some authors. In our case, we used the databases obtained by hailpad networks and the databases of C-band and S-Band radar to build an algorithm to estimate the vertical component of kinetic energy produced by a hail precipitation. In order to carry out this study, data on hail was gathered and analyzed from the hailpad networks in the province of Zaragoza (in the north-east of Spain) and the province of Mendoza (in Argentina, close to the Andes range on the border with Chile). These are two geographically distant regions, but which share a common characteristic: a high frequency of storms with hail precipitation, mainly during the summer months (S{\'{a}}nchez et al., 2009a). In order to compile the database, we have established two categories of kinetic energy: hail with low energy ({\textless}20Jm-2) and hail with high energy ({\textgreater}20Jm-2). With this information, we have looked to establish a differentiation between hail precipitation that hardly produces damage and, on the contrary, that which does (Dessens et al., 2007). Once these two categories were established, we constructed a logistic function that establishes a correspondence between radar variables and the two categories of kinetic energy. The results show great uncertainty in determining kinetic energy using C-band radar. However, for the S-band radar the results have shown that the probability of detection is 85.7{\%} with a FAR of 14.3{\%} and an explained variance of 61.2{\%}. This result allows us, with corresponding caution, to make a first estimation of the areas in which a hailstorm could produce damage. With the objective of making a meteorological interpretation of the results obtained (achieved only using statistic criteria), we have previously done an Principal Components Analysis (PCA). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Theoretical models exist for horizontal stratified atmospheres without clouds and currently becoming available are the first three-dimensional models that include broken cloud conditions. The experimental database for model verification is scarce for both ground and vertical distribution. To close this experimental gap an airborne system was developed and is described in this paper. An ultralight aircraft was used as an instrument platform to provide detailed measurements of radiation transfer in the ultraviolet and complimentary parameters that can be used for comparison with model calculations. The measurement system consists of standard, but in size and power consumption strongly modified, instruments. It produces a dataset covering upwelling and downwelling radiation as well as absorbing gase...},

Theoretical studies dating back to von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n, supported by laboratory and numerical studies, have yielded similarity theories for the size and spacing of these vortices behind bluff bodies. Despite dynamical differences between such two-dimensional flows and the three-dimensional flow past isolated islands, satellite case studies suggest these geometric similarities may also hold for the atmospheric case. In this study, two of the resulting dimensionless ratios are measured using satellite imagery. One is the aspect ratio between cross-street and along-street spacing of the vortices. The second is the ratio of the cross-street spacing to the crosswind width of the island. A 30-image sample from the Aqua and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellites is analyzed to obtain these ratios. The resulting set of values for the two dimensionless ratios is tested against the values f...},

abstract = {Daily station rainfall data in South Africa from 1936 to 1999 are
combined into homogeneous rainfall regions using Ward's clustering
method. Various rainfall characteristics are calculated for the summer
season, defined as December to February. These include seasonal rainfall
total, region-average number of station rain days exceeding 1 and
20 mm, region-average of periods between rain days at stations {\textgreater}1
and {\textgreater}20 mm, region-average of wet spell length (sequential days
of station rainfall {\textgreater}1 and {\textgreater}20 mm), correlation of daily station
rainfall within a region and correlation of seasonal station rainfall
anomalies within a {\{}region.Rank-ordered{\}} rainfall characteristic
data generally form an s-shaped curve, and significance testing of
discontinuities in these curves suggests that normal rainfall conditions
in South Africa consist of a combined middle three quintiles separated
from the outer quintiles, rather than the traditional middle {\{}tercile.The{\}}
relationships between the various rainfall characteristics show that
seasons with a high total rainfall generally have a higher number
of heavy rain days ({\textgreater}20 mm) and not necessarily an increase in
light rain days. The length of the period between rain days has a
low correlation to season totals, demonstrating that seasons with
a high total rainfall may still contain prolonged dry periods. These
additional rainfall characteristics are important to end-users, and
the analysis undertaken here offers a valuable starting point for
seeking physical relationships between rainfall characteristics and
the general circulation. Preliminary studies show that the vertical
mean wind is related to rainfall characteristics in South Africa.
Given that general circulation models capture this part of the circulation
adequately, seasonal forecasts of rainfall characteristics become
plausible. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 Royal Meteorological Society.},

@article{Hemmingsson2009,
abstract = {The altitude performance of two NO analysers using different NO detectors was studied. The analysers and their flow regulators were tested with simulated exhalations of reference gases. At 4000 m, volume flow was +35{\%} and mass flow -24{\%} of nominal in both instruments. The reduced mass flow increased the exhaled NO fraction by 26{\%} for a given rate of NO excretion. Furthermore, the electrochemical NO detector in one analyser showed an increased signal level for a given partial pressure of test gas. Taken together, these two effects increased the signal output by 60{\%} in comparison to the NO partial pressure. To avoid the above errors, it is proposed that the flow regulator should be readjusted to give a volume flow of 50 ml s(-1) at the altitude of interest and that the analyser should be recalibrated to the operational altitude. Finally, it is recommended that exhaled NO should always be reported as partial pressure and not as volume fraction, in order to compare measurements at any altitude.},

@article{pope_2002,
abstract = {Context Associations have been found between day-to-day particulate
air pollution and increased risk of various adverse health outcomes,
including cardiopulmonary mortality. However, studies of health effects
of long-term particulate air pollution have been less conclusive.
Objective To assess the relationship between long-term exposure to
fine particulate air pollution and all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary
mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants Vital status and cause
of death data were collected by the American Cancer Society as part
of the Cancer Prevention II study, an ongoing prospective mortality
study, which enrolled approximately 1.2 million adults in 1982. Participants
completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age,
sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status,
diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk
factor data for approximately 500 000 adults were linked with air
pollution data for metropolitan areas throughout the United States
and combined with vital status and cause of death data through December
31, 1998. Main Outcome Measure All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary
mortality. Results Fine particulate and sulfur oxide-related pollution
were associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary
mortality. Each 10-{\{}micro{\}}g/m3 elevation in fine particulate air
pollution was associated with approximately a 4{\%}, 6{\%}, and 8{\%} increased
risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively.
Measures of coarse particle fraction and total suspended particles
were not consistently associated with mortality. Conclusion Long-term
exposure to combustion-related fine particulate air pollution is
an important environmental risk factor for cardiopulmonary and lung
cancer mortality.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper, which focuses on emissions from China's coal-fired power plants during 1990–2010, is the second in a series of papers that aims to develop high-resolution emission inventory for China. This is the first time that emissions from China's coal-fired power plants were estimated at unit level for a 20 year period. This inventory is constructed from a unit-based database compiled in this study, named the China coal-fired Power plant Emissions Database (CPED), which includes detailed information on the technologies, activity data, operation situation, emission factors, and locations of individual units and supplements with aggregated data where unit-based information is not available.

Driven by the accelerated economy growth, large power plants were constructed throughout the country after 2000, resulting in dramatic growth in emissions. Growth trend of emissions has been effective curbed since 2005 due to strengthened emission control measures including the installation of flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) systems and the optimization of the generation fleet mix by promoting large units and decommissioning small ones. Compared to previous emission inventories, CPED significantly improved the spatial resolution and temporal profile of power plant emission inventory in China by extensive use of underlying data at unit level. The new inventory developed in this study will enable a close examination for temporal and spatial variations of power plant emissions in China and will help to improve the performances of chemical transport models by providing more accurate emission data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The fine particle mass concentrations peaked at 1000lg/m3 for PM2.5. Ambient carbon mass concentrations ranged from 20 to 40lg/m3. Single particle analysis confirmed that the fine particle fraction was dominated by organic particles. The topographical conditions, causing a low inversion, together with the high amounts of emissions from biomass burning, result in unacceptable levels of air pollution and pose a considerable health threat to the population.},

abstract = {The recently developed particle-resolved aerosol box model PartMC-MOSAIC (Particle Monte Carlo model-Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry) was used to rigorously simulate the evolution of aerosol mixing state and the associated optical and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation properties in an idealized urban plume. The model explicitly resolved the size and composition of individual particles from a number of sources and tracked their evolution due to condensation, evaporation, coagulation, emission, and dilution. The ensemble black carbon (BC)-specific absorption cross section increased by 40{\%} over the course of 2 days due to BC aging by condensation and coagulation. Threefold and fourfold enhancements in CCN/CN ratios were predicted to occur within 6 h for 0.2{\%} and 0.5{\%} supersaturations (S), respectively. The particle-resolved results were used to evaluate the errors in the optical and CCN activation properties that would be predicted by a conventional sectional framework that assumes monodisperse, internally mixed particles within each bin. This assumption artificially increased the ensemble BC-specific absorption by 14-30{\%} and decreased the single scattering albedo (SSA) by 0.03-0.07, while the bin resolution had a negligible effect. In contrast, the errors in CCN/CN ratios were sensitive to the bin resolution for a chosen supersaturation. For S = 0.2{\%}, the CCN/CN ratio predicted using 100 internally mixed bins was up to 25{\%} higher than the particle-resolved results, while it was up to 125{\%} higher using 10 internally mixed bins. Neglecting coagulation overpredicted aerosol water content and number concentrations ({\textless}0.2 mu m), causing errors in SSA from -0.02 to 0.035 and overprediction of CCN concentrations by 25-80{\%} at S = 0.5{\%}.},

@article{Romero1999,
abstract = {This paper is a contribution to the understanding of the topoclimatic and environmental geography of the basin where Santiago — one of the most polluted Latin American city – is located. In the first part, land-use change is analysed looking at the climatic transformation caused by the rapid transit from natural semiarid surface to urban areas. In the second part, seasonal weather and daily cycles of slope winds and the available ventilation are described trying to relate those patterns with the spatial distribution of air pollution. A combination of meteorological, geographical and cultural factors explain extreme air pollution events: meteorologically, Santiago is under permanent subsidence inversion layers. Geographically, the city is located in a closed basin surrounded by mountains. Culturally, the urban area has the highest population concentration (40{\%} of the national total), industries (near 70{\%} of the total) and vehicles, which are the main sources of smog. The urban and suburban transport system is based on a large number of buses (diesel) and private cars, both experiencing a rapid growth from the past few years. The city and specially the transport system generates high emissions of pollutant, but the natural semiarid deforested soils and slopes are also important sources. The local wind system can explain the differential spatial distribution on the concentration of air pollutants in the city and its periphery. In winter (rain season) concentrations of particulate matter are higher at the centre and the SW part of the city. The andean piedmont area (E part of the city) shows minimum values, suggesting major ventilation effects of slope and valley winds. Ozone exceeds air quality standards in summer (dry season) at all sites in the centre and periphery. However, the O3-concentrations are higher on preferred residential areas located at the piedmont area (E part of the city), suggesting air pollution transport effects. Currently, there is no consideration of these local climatic features in the process of urban planning.},

abstract = {This paper documents the main features of the climate and climate variability over South America, on the basis of instrumental observations gathered during the 20th Century. It should provide a modern reference framework for paleoclimate research in South America, targeting high-resolution proxies over the past few centuries. Several datasets suitable for present-day climate research are first described, highlighting their advantages as well as their limitations. We then provide a basic physical understanding of the mean annual cycle of the precipitation and atmospheric circulation over the continent and the adjacent oceans. In particular, the diversity of precipitation, temperature and wind patterns is interpreted in terms of the long meridional extent of the continent and the disruption of the large-scale circulation caused by the Andes cordillera, the contrasting oceanic boundary conditions and the landmass distribution. Similarly, the intensity and timing of the interannual and interdecadal climatic fluctuations exhibit considerable geographical dependence, as some regions are more influenced by large-scale phenomena rooted in the tropical oceans while others are more influenced by high-latitude phenomena. The impact of these large-scale phenomena over South America is documented by a regression analysis between selected atmospheric indices and the precipitation and temperature fields. We have included a discussion on the seasonality and long-term stability of such impacts, and complemented our general description by an updated review of the literature on climate variability over specific regions.},

We show that accuracies of a few percent of the separation distance can be readily achieved, and we develop a technique for aligning the datasets from the two aircraft to correct for variations in the longitudinal component of the displacement vector. We then derive an expression for the variance of the difference between measurements of the same variable on each aircraft as a function of averaging time and separation distance. An example of data from a series of formation flights over eastern Colorado is used to demonstrate the techniques for estimating the displacement vector, aligning the datasets, and calculating. lateral coherences and phase angles.},

abstract = {The effects of anthropogenic aerosol particles on the growth by condensation of droplets in warm clouds over Mexico City are studied with a spectral microphysical air parcel model. The atmospheric aerosol introduced in the model is an external mixture of inorganic and organic particles. It is found that high concentrations of particles smaller than 2.5 $\mu$m are responsible for two phenomena which may have a negative effect on warm precipitation development. The first phenomenon is a suppression of the supersaturation maximum near the base of the cloud and, as a consequence, the absence of a mode in a droplet spectrum which normally is formed by droplets nucleated near the cloud base and is a source of mass for growth by coalescence. The second phenomenon, caused by high concentrations of pollutants with diameters smaller than 2.5 $\mu$m, is the delay in the growth of the largest droplets due to a reduction in supersaturation and the competition for water vapor. It is also shown that the shape of droplet spectra depends on the chemical composition of aerosol particles: a mixture of organic and inorganic particles favors the formation of bimodal spectra, whereas aerosol particles composed exclusively of inorganic particles tend to produce droplet spectra with only one peak. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {On continental to regional scales feedbacks between landuse and landcover change and climate have been widely documented over the past 10-15 years. In the present study we explore the possibility that also vegetation changes over much smaller areas may affect local precipitation regimes. Large scale (∼ 105 ha) irrigated plantations in semi-arid environments under particular conditions may affect local circulations and induce additional rainfall. Capturing this rainfall 'surplus' could then reduce the need for external irrigation sources and eventually lead to self-sustained water cycling. This concept is studied in the coastal plains in South West Saudi Arabia where the mountains of the Asir region exhibit the highest rainfall of the peninsula due to orographic lifting and condensation of moisture imported with the Indian Ocean monsoon and with disturbances from the Mediterranean Sea. We use a regional atmospheric modeling system (RAMS) forced by ECMWF analysis data to resolve the effect of complex surface conditions in high resolution ($\Delta$x = 4 km). After validation, these simulations are analysed with a focus on the role of local processes (sea breezes, orographic lifting and the formation of fog in the coastal mountains) in generating rainfall, and on how these will be affected by large scale irrigated plantations in the coastal desert. The validation showed that the model simulates the regional and local weather reasonably well. The simulations exhibit a slightly larger diurnal temperature range than those captured by the observations, but seem to capture daily sea-breeze phenomena well. Monthly rainfall is well reproduced at coarse resolutions, but appears more localized at high resolutions. The hypothetical irrigated plantation (3.25 105 ha) has significant effects on atmospheric moisture, but due to weakened sea breezes this leads to limited increases of rainfall. In terms of recycling of irrigation gifts the rainfall enhancement in this particular setting is rather insignificant. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The global continental haze pattern was evaluated based on daily average visibility data at 7000 surface weather stations over five years, 1994–98. The data processing consisted of three broad categories of filters: (1) validity of individual data points, (2) filters based on statistics for specific stations, and (3) filters based on spatial analysis. The data are presented as the aerosol extinction coefficient (Bext or haze) at the surface, seasonally aggregated over five years. The data reveal that the continental haze is concentrated over distinct aerosol regions of the world. The haziest regions of Asia are the Indian subcontinent, eastern China, and Indochina where the 75 percentile seasonal Bext exceeds 0.4 km−1. In Africa, the highest year around extinction coefficient {\textgreater}0.4 km−1 is found over Mauritania, Mali and Niger. During December, January, February, the savanna region of sub-Saharan Africa shows similar values. The haziest region of South America is over Bolivia, adjacent to the Andes mountain range, with a peak during August–November (0.4–0.6 km−1). In North America and Europe, there are isolated haze pockets, such as the San Joaquin Valley in California and the Po River Valley in the northern Italy. In many regions of the world the size, shape, and intensity of hazy pockets is determined by the topographic barriers. A major qualification of this work is that the haze maps are based on daily average visibility which emphasizes humid regions with hygroscopic aerosols (nighttime peak Bext) and de-emphasizes arid, dusty regions with daytime maximum extinction. Regional haze episodes over several continental aerosol regions are illustrated by truecolor rendering of the reflectance data from the SeaWiFS satellite.},

In general, the flow is in line with existing knowledge, but there is a remarkable absence of vortices with anticyclonic rotation. Atmospheric conditions for vortices of this kind are most often favorable in late winter and spring and they are a forecasting challenge.},

abstract = {To study the effect of giant cloud condensation nuclei (GCCN) on precipitation processes in stratocumulus clouds, 1–10 $\mu$m diameter salt particles (salt powder) were released from an aircraft while flying near cloud top on 3 August 2011 off the central coast of California. The seeded area was subsequently sampled from the aircraft that was equipped with aerosol, cloud, and precipitation probes and an upward-facing cloud radar. During post-seeding sampling, made 30–60 min after seeding, the mean cloud droplet size increased, the droplet number concentration decreased, and large drop (e.g., diameter larger than 10 $\mu$m) concentration increased. Average drizzle rates increased from about 0.05 to 0.20 mm h−1, and liquid water path decreased from about 52 to 43 g m−2. Strong radar returns associated with drizzle were observed on the post-seeding cloud-base level-leg flights and were accompanied by a substantial depletion of the cloud liquid water content. The changes were large enough to suggest that the salt particles with concentrations estimated to be 10−2 to 10−4 cm−3 resulted in a four-fold increase in the cloud base rainfall rate and depletion of the cloud water due to rainout. In contrast, a case is shown where the cloud was already precipitating (on 10 August) and the effect of adding GCCN to the cloud was insignificant.},

abstract = {Large cloud condensational nuclei (CCN) affect droplet spectrum evolution in two ways: first, droplets growing on these nuclei are larger than others and accelerate the collision of cloud droplets having larger collision kernel; second, the condensation growth of large soluble aerosols between cloud base and the level of supersaturation maximum decreases the magnitude of the maximum which prevents activation of the smallest or less soluble nuclei and decreases the concentration of nucleated droplets. The latter process is known as competition effect. This effect is usually assumed to be an important factor leading to the rain enhancement by hygroscopic seeding. This study tests the hypothesis that the magnitude of the supersaturation maximum is reduced significantly when large CCN are present. A 2000 bin 1-D cloud parcel model was used to test this hypothesis. The model calculates diffusion aerosol growth and corresponding decrease in air relative humidity both below and above cloud base. It explicitly simulates droplet nucleation without any parameterization. The model calculates droplet concentration at the level of the supersaturation maximum under different concentrations and sizes of large soluble nuclei. Collisions are calculated by solving a stochastic kinetic equation for collision. The results of our investigation indicate that the previous studies have overestimated the efficiency of competition effect. The reasons of the overestimation of the effect in earlier studies are presented. The main effect of large soluble aerosols is the formation of large droplets which accelerate droplet collisions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Emission ratios and emission factors are given for eight species that have not been reported previously for biomass burning of savanna in southern Africa (namely, dimethyl sulfide, methyl nitrate, five hydrocarbons, and particles with diameters from 0.1 to 3 microns). The emission factor that we measured for ammonia is lower by a factor of 4, and the emission factors for formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and CN are greater by factors of about 3, 20, and 3 - 15, respectively, than previously reported values. The new emission factors are used to estimate annual emissions of these species from savanna fires in Africa and worldwide.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a detailed study of the spatial and seasonal$\backslash$naerosol climatology over South Africa (SA), based on Multiangle Imaging$\backslash$nSpectroradiometer (MISR) data. We have used 10 years (2000-2009) of MISR$\backslash$nmonthly mean aerosol extinction (tau(ext)), absorption (tau(a)) optical$\backslash$ndepths at 558 nm, Angstrom exponents in visible (VIS; 446-672 nm) and$\backslash$nnear-infrared (NIR; 672-866 nm) spectral bands, and the extracted$\backslash$nspectral curvature. The study has shown that, in terms of aerosol load$\backslash$nlevel spatial variation, SA can be classified into three parts: the$\backslash$nupper, central, and lower, which illustrate high, medium, and low$\backslash$naerosol loadings, respectively. The results for the three parts of SA$\backslash$nare presented in detail. The prevailing sources of aerosols are$\backslash$ndifferent in each part of SA. The lower part is dominated by the air$\backslash$nmass transport from the surrounding marine environment and other SA or$\backslash$nneighboring regions, while the central and upper parts are loaded$\backslash$nthrough wind-ablated mineral dust and local anthropogenic activities.$\backslash$nDuring the biomass burning seasons (July-September), the central part of$\backslash$nSA is more affected than the rest of SA by the biomass-burning aerosols$\backslash$n(based on tau(a), similar to 20{\%} higher than the rest of SA). In$\backslash$nalignment with the observed higher values of tau(ext), aerosol size$\backslash$ndistributions were found to be highly variable in the upper part of SA,$\backslash$nwhich is due to the high population and the$\backslash$nindustrial/mining/agricultural activities in this area.},

Significant metallurgical beneficiation of ores does occur in South Africa. The role of metallurgy in economic beneficiation will be examined in terms of current practice and the potential for expansion.

abstract = {We examine the hygroscopic properties of particles freshly emitted
from laboratory biomass burning experiments conducted during the
second Fire Lab At Missoula Experiment (FLAME-II). Values of the
hygroscopicity parameter, kappa, were derived from both hygroscopic
growth measurements and size-resolved (30nm in diameter) cloud condensation
nuclei (CCN) measurements for smokes emitted by the open combustion
of 24 biomass fuels from the United States and Asia. To analyze the
complex cloud condensation nuclei response curves we propose a new
inversion scheme that corrects for multiple charge effects without
the necessity of prior assumptions about the chemical composition
and mixing state of the particles. Kappa varied between 0.02 (weakly
hygroscopic) and 0.8 (highly hygroscopic). For individual smokes,
kappa was a function of particle size, with 250 nm particles being
generally weakly hygroscopic and sub-100 nm particles being more
hygroscopic. At any given size the emissions were often externally
mixed, showing more and less hygroscopic growth modes and bimodal
CCN activation spectra. Comparisons between growth factor-derived
and CCN-derived hygroscopicities were consistent when taking this
heterogeneity into account. A conceptual model of biomass burning
emissions suggests that most particles are CCN active at the point
of emission and do not require conversion in the atmosphere to more
hygroscopic compositions before they can participate in cloud formation
and undergo wet deposition.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the effects of aerosol particles on the formation$\backslash$nof convective clouds and precipitation in the Eastern Mediterranean$\backslash$nSea, with a special emphasis on the role of mineral dust particles$\backslash$nin these processes. We used a new detailed numerical cloud microphysics$\backslash$nscheme that has been implemented in the Weather Research and Forecast$\backslash$n(WRF) model in order to study aerosol–cloud interaction in 3-D configuration$\backslash$nbased on 1° × 1° resolution reanalysis meteorological data. Using$\backslash$na number of sensitivity studies, we tested the contribution of mineral$\backslash$ndust particles and different ice nucleation parameterizations to$\backslash$nprecipitation development. In this study we also investigated the$\backslash$nimportance of recycled (regenerated) aerosols that had been released$\backslash$nto the atmosphere following the evaporation of cloud droplets. $\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe results showed that increased aerosol concentration due to the$\backslash$npresence of mineral dust enhanced the formation of ice crystals.$\backslash$nThe dynamic evolution of the cloud system sets the time periods and$\backslash$nregions in which heavy or light precipitation occurred in the domain.$\backslash$nThe precipitation rate, the time and duration of precipitation were$\backslash$naffected by the aerosol properties only at small spatial scales (with$\backslash$nareas of about 20 km2). Changes of the ice nucleation scheme from$\backslash$nice supersaturation-dependent parameterization to a recent approach$\backslash$nof aerosol concentration and temperature-dependent parameterization$\backslash$nmodified the ice crystals concentrations but did not affect the total$\backslash$nprecipitation in the domain. Aerosol regeneration modified the concentration$\backslash$nof cloud droplets at cloud base by dynamic recirculation of the aerosols$\backslash$nbut also had only a minor effect on precipitation. $\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe major conclusion from this study is that the effect of mineral$\backslash$ndust particles on clouds and total precipitation is limited by the$\backslash$nproperties of the atmospheric dynamics and the only effect of aerosol$\backslash$non precipitation may come from significant increase in the concentration$\backslash$nof accumulation mode aerosols. In addition, the presence of mineral$\backslash$ndust had a much smaller effect on the total precipitation than on$\backslash$nits spatial distribution.},

abstract = {This paper describes the institutional and resource challenges and opportunities in getting different sectors in eThekwini Municipality (the local government responsible for planning and managing the city of Durban) to recognize and respond to their role in climate change adaptation. The Headline Climate Change Adaptation Strategy launched by the municipality in 2006 did not catalyze the development of sectoral plans or significantly influence the Integrated Development Plan, the key document through which the municipal government sets and implements development priorities. Possible causal factors for this include limited human and financial resources and more immediate and urgent development needs. To address the situation, the municipality's Environmental Planning and Climate Protection Department encouraged and supported three pilot sectors to develop their own municipal adaptation plans. This more sectoral approach encouraged greater interaction among the sectors and provided each with a clearer understanding of their needs and roles from an adaptation perspective. It also highlighted how climate change adaptation could be used as a tool to address development priorities. This work will be extended through research into the cost-benefits of Durban being an " early adapter " . Work has also begun on community-based adaptation (including support for reforestation projects that provide " green jobs ") and on responses to slow onset disasters, food security and water constraints.},

Understanding the main synoptic conditions that give rise to dust outbreaks is important for issuing forecasts and warnings to the public in cases of severe storms. The aim of the present study is to determine synoptic patterns that are associated with or even favor dust outbreaks over the Arabian Peninsula. In this respect, red–green–blue dust composite images from the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite are used to detect dust outbreaks affecting the Arabian Peninsula, with possible influences in southwestern Asia and northeastern Africa, between 2005 and 2013. The Meteosat imagery yielded a sample of 95 dust storm days. Meteorological fields from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data of wind fields at 10 m and 250 hPa, mean sea level pressure, and geopotential heights at 850 and 500 hPa were obtained for the dust storm days. Using principal component analysis in T-mode and non-hierarchical k-means clustering, we obtained four major atmospheric circulation patterns associated with dust outbreaks during the study days. Cluster 4 had the largest number of days with dust events, which were constrained to summer, and cluster 3 had the fewest. In clusters 1, 2 and 3, the jet stream favored the entry of a low-pressure area or trough that varied in location between the three clusters. Their most northerly location was found in cluster 4, along with an extensive low-pressure area supporting strong winds over the Arabian Peninsula. The spatial distribution of aerosol optical depth for each cluster obtained was characterized using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data. Then, using METAR stations, clusters were also characterized in terms of frequency and visibility.},

abstract = {Methane retrievals from the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer
for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) instrument onboard ENVISAT
provide important information on atmospheric CH4 sources, particularly
in tropical regions which are poorly monitored by in situ surface
observations. Recently, Frankenberg et al. (2008a, 2008b) reported
a major revision of SCIAMACHY retrievals due to an update of spectroscopic
parameters of water vapor and CH4. Here, we analyze the impact of
this revision on global and regional CH4 emissions estimates in 2004,
using the TM5-4DVAR inverse modeling system. Inversions based on
the revised SCIAMACHY retrievals yield 20{\%} lower tropical emissions
compared to the previous retrievals. The new retrievals improve significantly
the consistency between observed and assimilated column average mixing
ratios and the agreement with independent validation data. Furthermore,
the considerable latitudinal and seasonal bias correction of the
previous SCIAMACHY retrievals, derived in the TM5-4DVAR system by
simultaneously assimilating high-accuracy surface measurements, is
reduced by a factor 3. The inversions result in significant changes
in the spatial patterns of emissions and their seasonality compared
to the bottom-up inventories. Sensitivity tests were done to analyze
the robustness of retrieved emissions, revealing some dependence
on the applied a priori emission inventories and OH fields. Furthermore,
we performed a detailed validation of simulated CH4 mixing ratios
using NOAA ship and aircraft profile samples, as well as stratospheric
balloon samples, showing overall good agreement. We use the new SCIAMACHY
retrievals for a regional analysis of CH4 emissions from South America,
Africa, and Asia, exploiting the zooming capability of the TM5 model.
This allows a more detailed analysis of spatial emission patterns
and better comparison with aircraft profiles and independent regional
emission estimates available for South America. Large CH4 emissions
are attributed to various wetland regions in tropical South America
and Africa, seasonally varying and opposite in phase with CH4 emissions
from biomass burning. India, China and South East Asia are characterized
by pronounced emissions from rice paddies peaking in the third quarter
of the year, in addition to further anthropogenic emissions throughout
the year.},

It is anticipated that by year 2019, the generation mix will be at 64{\%} coal, 32{\%} gas and 4{\%} hydro. Due to the increase in coal consumption for power generation, there is a critical need to evaluate the health risks for the population living in the vicinity of a coal-fired power plant in Malaysia. To date, such study related to the plant in Malaysia has never been published. In this study, health risk assessment (HRA) for air emission from a coal-fired power plant in Malaysia was carried out. Two pollutants from the Proposed New Environmental Quality (Clean Air) Regulation 201X (Draft) (i.e. SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and Hg) were assessed for non-carcinogenic health risk, and two trace elements (i.e. As and Cr) were assessed for carcinogenic health risk. Both short-term and long-term health effects were evaluated. Air dispersion modelling (AERMOD) was used to predict the ground level concentration (GLC) within 10 km radius of the emission source. Based on the HRA, different health risks were identified for short-term and long-term dispersion of the studied pollutants. The findings indicate that a detailed assessment on the short-term and long-term health effects of the emissions from coal-fired power plant in Malaysia with meteorological factor as one of the significant factors influencing the emissions level is needed.},

abstract = {Existing methods for dynamic calibration of tipping-bucket rain gauges (TBRs) can be time consuming and labor intensive. A new automated dynamic calibration system has been developed to calibrate TBRs with minimal effort. The system consists of a programmable pump, datalogger, digital balance, and computer. Calibration is performed in two steps: 1) pump calibration and 2) rain gauge calibration. Pump calibration ensures precise control of water flow rates delivered to the rain gauge funnel; rain gauge calibration ensures precise conversion of bucket tip times to actual rainfall rates. Calibration of the pump and one rain gauge for 10 selected pump rates typically requires about 8 h. Data files generated during rain gauge calibration are used to compute rainfall intensities and amounts from a record of bucket tip times collected in the field. The system was tested using 5 types of commercial TBRs (15.2-, 20.3-, and 30.5-cm diameters; 0.1-, 0.2-, and 1.0-mm resolutions) and using 14 TBRs of a single type (20.3-cm diameter; 0.1-mm resolution). Ten pump rates ranging from 3 to 154 mL min[sup-1] were used to calibrate the TBRs and represented rainfall rates between 6 and 254 mm h[sup-1] depending on the rain gauge diameter. All pump calibration results were very linear with R[sup2] values greater than 0.99. All rain gauges exhibited large nonlinear underestimation errors (between 5{\%} and 29{\%}) that decreased with increasing rain gauge resolution and increased with increasing rainfall rate, especially for rates greater than 50 mm h[sup-1]. Calibration curves of bucket tip time against the reciprocal of the true pump rate for all rain gauges also were linear with R 2 values of 0.99. Calibration data for the 14 rain gauges of the same type were very similar, as indicated by slope values that were within 14{\%} of each other and ranged from about 367 to 417 s mm h[sup-1]. The developed system can calibrate TBRs efficiently, accurately, and virtually unattended and could... [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] },

abstract = {Global efforts to mitigate climate change are guided by projections of future temperatures. But the eventual equilibrium global mean temperature associated with a given stabilization level of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations remains uncertain, complicating the setting of stabilization targets to avoid potentially dangerous levels of global warming. Similar problems apply to the carbon cycle: observations currently provide only a weak constraint on the response to future emissions. Here we use ensemble simulations of simple climate-carbon-cycle models constrained by observations and projections from more comprehensive models to simulate the temperature response to a broad range of carbon dioxide emission pathways. We find that the peak warming caused by a given cumulative carbon dioxide emission is better constrained than the warming response to a stabilization scenario. Furthermore, the relationship between cumulative emissions and peak warming is remarkably insensitive to the emission pathway (timing of emissions or peak emission rate). Hence policy targets based on limiting cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide are likely to be more robust to scientific uncertainty than emission-rate or concentration targets. Total anthropogenic emissions of one trillion tonnes of carbon (3.67 trillion tonnes of CO(2)), about half of which has already been emitted since industrialization began, results in a most likely peak carbon-dioxide-induced warming of 2 degrees C above pre-industrial temperatures, with a 5-95{\%} confidence interval of 1.3-3.9 degrees C.},

abstract = {In characterizing the patterns of climate change across Saudi Arabia, several extreme indices are calculated from station values daily maximum and minimum temperature data. The trend analyses are performed on 13 annual extreme indices for Saudi Arabia, using observations from 27 surface stations with high-quality data for the period 1981-2010. RClimDex is used to calculate the indices, and simple regression methods are employed for the trend analysis. The analyses of extreme temperature indices detected a significant increase in the majority of the stations, which further indicates that the country has experienced a warming trend. The findings show that 92/89{\%} of the stations displayed a significant increase in the annual occurrence of warm days/nights and 96/93{\%} revealed a significant decrease for the occurrence of cool days/nights. Time-series analysis has also shown an important feature of the climate change signal. When the dataset is divided into two sub-periods, the analysis reveals a distinctive long-term trend that clearly distinguishes the two periods. It was found that the temperature extremes (hot and cold) in Saudi Arabia have increased significantly with greater magnitude in the recent-past (1996-2010) compared to the previous period (1981-1995). The most telling evidence for this is the heat- and cold-waves, where indices of both have occurred more frequently in the second part of the two sub-periods. {\textcopyright} 2013 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {This paper addresses rainfall radar measurement in mountainous areas
where numerous catchments subject to flash flooding are located.
The main sources of error affecting the quantitative use of weather
radar data are examined with special attention paid to the influence
of topography and altitude. A radar in a mountainous region is affected
by specific measurement errors such as beam blockage; other sources
of error like bright band interception can be enhanced by the effect
of altitude. This work is based on data collected during the 86–88
C{\'{e}}vennes Experiment conducted in a mountainous Mediterranean region
in the south of France prone to flash floods. Analysis of the main
sources of error leads to the following observations. Beam blockage
can be corrected using digital terrain models with the correction
efficiency depending on the accuracy of the radar antenna pointing
direction. The influence of vertical variations in radar reflectivity
is shown to be taken into account at an hourly time step in order
to provide satisfactory range-dependent corrections. Additionally,
the control of the stability of the radar signal using strong ground
clutter is described. Because of attenuation effects, the use of
a 10-cm wavelength is recommended for surveying intense rain events
which regularly affect Mediterranean regions. The error due to an
unadapted Z–R relationship is shown to depend on the statistical
distribution of reflectivity over the catchment where the rainfall
measurement is utilized. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Eight regions covering the whole territory were defined based on the correlation of the mean annual hail frequency between all weather stations. Regions lying between 30?? and 40??S as well as those dominated by mountains present the highest hail frequencies in Argentina. The eastern and coastal areas of the country experience hail events mainly during springtime but they may start in late winter and continue through the beginning of summer. Events in western and central Argentina also predominate in spring but the maximum frequencies are observed during summer months. Trends in the annual number of hail events calculated for each region indicate that events in northwestern and northeastern Argentina have been increasing as well as in southern Patagonia. On the other hand, in central Argentina, southern Buenos Aires-La Pampa, northern Buenos Aires-Litoral and northern Patagonia trends are negative and statistically significant in the first two regions, basically by the decrease of events during spring and summer. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The total column density NO2 retrievals collated by a ground-based sun-tracking spectrometer (Pandora/GSFC) and the satellite-borne (Aura) Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) were compared to the concentrations measured by a ground-based gas-analyser at Welgegund, NWU's atmospheric monitoring station (Potchefstroom, South Africa) to study the comparability between columnar and surface NO2 measurements. The concurrent ground measurements performed over January- March, 2011, were averaged over one hour to correspond to the closest OMI overpasses ({\~{}}12:00 UTC). A novel method for estimating surface mixing ratios from total-column retrievals, via an atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) height correction factor as tested in the USA was applied (Knepp et al., 2013). This ABL correction factor largely corrects for boundary-layer variability throughout the day, and allows conversion into mixing ratios. Applicability of this technique was briefly explored for Welgegund site that is frequently exposed to background and polluted air masses. The coincidental quantitative and qualitative comparisons are presented.},

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Extreme rainfall events can have severe impacts on society, so possible
long-term changes in the intensity of extreme events are of concern.
Testing for long-term changes in the intensity of extreme events
is complicated by data inhomogeneities resulting from site and instrumentation
changes. Using rainfall data from stations in South Africa that have
not involved site relocations, but which have not been tested for
inhomogeneities resulting from changes in instrumentation, a method
of testing for changes in the intensity of extreme events is adopted.
Significant increases in the intensity of extreme rainfall events
between 1931{\^{a}}1960 and 1961{\^{a}}1990 are identified over about 70{\%}
of the country. The intensity of the 10-year high rainfall events
has increased by over 10{\%} over large areas of the country, except
in parts of the north-east, north-west and in the winter rainfall
region of the south-west. Percentage increases in the intensity of
high rainfall events are largest for the most extreme events. While
some inhomogeneities remain in the data used, the observed changes
in the intensity of extreme rainfall events over South Africa are
thought to be at least partly real.},

abstract = {Continuous monitors can be used to supplement traditional filter-based methods of determining personal exposure to air pollutants. They have the advantages of being able to identify nearby sources and detect temporal changes on a time scale of a few minutes. The Windsor Ontario Exposure Assessment Study (WOEAS) adopted an approach of using multiple continuous monitors to measure indoor, outdoor (near-residential) and personal exposures to PM₂.₅, ultrafine particles and black carbon. About 48 adults and households were sampled for five consecutive 24-h periods in summer and winter 2005, and another 48 asthmatic children for five consecutive 24-h periods in summer and winter 2006. This article addresses the laboratory and field validation of these continuous monitors. A companion article (Wheeler et al., 2010) provides similar analyses for the 24-h integrated methods, as well as providing an overview of the objectives and study design. The four continuous monitors were the DustTrak (Model 8520, TSI, St. Paul, MN, USA) and personal DataRAM (pDR) (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for PM₂.₅; the P-Trak (Model 8525, TSI) for ultrafine particles; and the Aethalometer (AE-42, Magee Scientific, Berkeley, CA, USA) for black carbon (BC). All monitors were tested in multiple co-location studies involving as many as 16 monitors of a given type to determine their limits of detection as well as bias and precision. The effect of concentration and electronic drift on bias and precision were determined from both the collocated studies and the full field study. The effect of rapid changes in environmental conditions on switching an instrument from indoor to outdoor sampling was also studied. The use of multiple instruments for outdoor sampling was valuable in identifying occasional poor performance by one instrument and in better determining local contributions to the spatial variation of particulate pollution. Both the DustTrak and pDR were shown to be in reasonable agreement (R² of 90 and 70{\%}, respectively) with the gravimetric PM₂.₅ method. Both instruments had limits of detection of about 5 $\mu$g/m³. The DustTrak and pDR had multiplicative biases of about 2.5 and 1.6, respectively, compared with the gravimetric samplers. However, their average bias-corrected precisions were {\textless}10{\%}, indicating that a proper correction for bias would bring them into very good agreement with standard methods. Although no standard methods exist to establish the bias of the Aethalometer and P-Trak, the precision was within 20{\%} for the Aethalometer and within 10{\%} for the P-Trak. These findings suggest that all four instruments can supply useful information in environmental studies.},

abstract = {Passive sampling is based on the phenomenon of mass transport due to the difference between chemical potentials of analytes in a given environmental compartment and the collection medium inside a dosimeter. The subsequent laboratory procedure (i.e. extraction, identification and determination of analytes) is the same as in the case of classic sampling techniques. Passive sampling techniques are characterized by simplicity with regard to the dosimeter's construction as well as its maintenance. Therefore, they find ever increasing application in the field of environmental research and analytics. When choosing a passive sampling method, one should not forget that some passive samplers require the time-consuming calibration step before being used in the field. Novel solutions and modifications of existing sampler designs have been presented. Practical application of passive dosimetry in environmental analytics, including sampling of water, soil, air and other atypical media are discussed. Some aspects of calibration methods in passive dosimetry are also described. The latest trends in the application of passive sampling are highlighted.},

@article{Kawecki2018,
abstract = {We examine how aerosol composition affects precipitation intensity using the Weather and Research Forecasting Model with Chemistry (version 3.6). By changing the prescribed default hygroscopicity values to updated values from laboratory studies, we test model assumptions about individual component hygroscopicity values of ammonium, sulfate, nitrate, and organic species. We compare a baseline simulation (BASE, using default hygroscopicity values) with four sensitivity simulations (SULF, increasing the sulfate hygroscopicity; ORG, decreasing organic hygroscopicity; SWITCH, using a concentration-dependent hygroscopicity value for ammonium; and ALL, including all three changes) to understand the role of aerosol composition on precipitation during a mesoscale convective system (MCS). Overall, the hygroscopicity changes influence the spatial patterns of precipitation and the intensity. Focusing on the maximum precipitation in the model domain downwind of an urban area, we find that changing the individual component hygroscopicities leads to bulk hygroscopicity changes, especially in the ORG simulation. Reducing bulk hygroscopicity (e.g., ORG simulation) initially causes fewer activated drops, weakened updrafts in the midtroposphere, and increased precipitation from larger hydrometeors. Increasing bulk hygroscopicity (e.g., SULF simulation) simulates more numerous and smaller cloud drops and increases precipitation. In the ALL simulation, a stronger cold pool and downdrafts lead to precipitation suppression later in the MCS evolution. In this downwind region, the combined changes in hygroscopicity (ALL) reduces the overprediction of intense events ({\textgreater}70 mm d−1) and better captures the range of moderate intensity (30–60 mm d−1) events. The results of this single MCS analysis suggest that aerosol composition can play an important role in simulating high-intensity precipitation events. {\textcopyright}2017.

abstract = {Dual polarization is becoming the standard for new weather radar systems, like the new Austrian C-band weather radar on the Valluga mountain. In contrast to conven- tionalweather radars,where the reflectivity is measured in one polarization plane only, a dual polarization radar provides transmission in either horizontal, vertical, or both polarizations while receiving both the horizontal and vertical channels simultaneously. Since hydrometeors are not exactly spherical, the back-scatter and propagation is dif- ferent for horizontal and vertical polarization. Comparing the reflected horizontal and vertical power returns and their ratio and correlation, information on the size, shape, and ice density of cloud and precipitation particles can be obtained. Polarimetric radar variables are expected to increase the accuracy of the rainrate estimation compared to standard Z-R relationship of non-polarimetric radars. For the Valluga radar rainrate estimators based on Zh/ZDR and KDP/ZDR relationships are implemented. Deriv- ing the type of precipitation from dual polarization parameters can be difficult, since there is no clear discrimination between the different values. Fuzzy logic approaches have been shown to work well with overlapping conditions and imprecisely defined class output. The CSU hydrometeor classification model with adaptations for C-band is selected for the Valluga radar. The preliminary implementation has been verified with simulated data based on recorded precipitation events. In this paper details of the implementation, first results and evaluations are presented.},

abstract = {Progress in urban climatology over the two decades since the first
publication of the International Journal of Climatology is reviewed.
It is emphasized that urban climatology during this period has benefited
from conceptual advances made in microclimatology and boundary-layer
climatology in general. The role of scale, heterogeneity, dynamic
source areas for turbulent fluxes and the complexity introduced by
the roughness sublayer over the tall, rigid roughness elements of
cities is described. The diversity of urban heat islands, depending
on the medium sensed and the sensing technique, is explained. The
review focuses on two areas within urban climatology. First, it assesses
advances in the study of selected urban climatic processes relating
to urban atmospheric turbulence (including surface roughness) and
exchange processes for energy and water, at scales of consideration
ranging from individual facets of the urban environment, through
streets and city blocks to neighbourhoods. Second, it explores the
literature on the urban temperature field. The state of knowledge
about urban heat islands around 1980 is described and work since
then is assessed in terms of similarities to and contrasts with that
situation. Finally, the main advances are summarized and recommendations
for urban climate work in the future are made. Copyright {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2003

abstract = {Aerosol optical properties over a southern sub-tropical site Skukuza, South Africa were studied to determine the variability of the aerosol characteristics using CIMEL Sunphotometer data as part of the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) from December 2005 to November 2006. Aerosol optical depth (AOD), {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m exponent ($\alpha$), and columnar water vapor (CWV) data were collected, analyzed, and compiled. Participating in this network provided a unique opportunity for understanding the sources of aerosols affecting the atmosphere of South Africa (SA) and the regional radiation budget. The meteorological patterns significantly (p{\textless}0.05) influenced the amount and size distribution of the aerosols. Results showed that seasonal variation of AOD at 500nm (AOD500) over the observation site were characterized by low values (0.10-0.13) in autumn, moderate values (0.14-0.16) in summer and winter seasons, and high to very high values (0.18-0.40) during the spring, with an overall mean value of 0.18±0.12. {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m exponent $\alpha$440-870, varied from 0.5 to 2.89, with significant (p{\textless}0.0001) seasonal variability. CWV showed a strong annual cycle with maximum values in the summer and autumn seasons. The relationship between AOD, {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m exponent ($\alpha$), and CWV showed a strong dependence (p{\textless}0.0001) of $\alpha$ on AOD and CWV, while there was no significant correlation between AOD and CWV. Investigation of the adequacy of the simple use of the spectral AOD and {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m exponent data was used in deriving the curvature (a2) showed to obtain information for determining the aerosol-particle size. The negative a2 values are characterized by aerosol-size dominated by fine-mode (0.1-1$\mu$m), while the positive curvatures indicate abundance of coarse particles ({\textgreater}1$\mu$m). Trajectory cluster analyses revealed that the air masses during the autumn and winter seasons have longer advection pathways, passing over the ocean and continent. This is reflected in the aerosol properties that are derived from the ocean, desert, and anthropogenic activities that include biomass burning and industrial pollution. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This note presents vertical concentration profiles of various size fractions of suspended partic- ulate matter, measured over the first three metres from ground in a street canyon, using a novel sampling system. The daily average percentage difference of airborne particulate matter concentration between receptor heights 0.81 and 2.88 m, with the lower height taken as reference, was more than 35{\%} for PM  and more than 12{\%} for the inhalable fraction, for 5 out of the 7 days of measurement. These preliminary measurements, carried out during June-August 1997, consisting of 37 h of data, corroborate the idea put forward by Colls and Micallef (Atmospheric Environment 31, 4253—4254), that different height groups of the population are exposed to different concentrations. Air-quality standards, based on human exposure estimates, should take this variation into account. These measurements also have implications for the siting of urban air quality monitoring systems.},

abstract = {Droughts are difficult to detect and monitor. Drought indices, most commonly the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), have been used with limited success as operational drought monitoring tools and triggers for policy responses. Recently, a new index, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), was developed to improve drought detection and monitoring capabilities. The SPI has several characteristics that are an improvement over previous indices, including its simplicity and temporal flexibility, that allow its application for water resources on all timescales. In this article, the 1996 drought in the southern plains and southwestern United States is examined using the SPI. A series of maps are used to illustrate how the SPI would have assisted in being able to detect the onset of the drought and monitor its progression. A case study investigating the drought in greater detail for Texas is also given. The SPI demonstrated that it is a tool that should be used operationally as part of a state, regional, or national drought watch system in the United States. During the 1996 drought, the SPI detected the onset of the drought at least 1 month in advance of the PDSI. This timeliness will be invaluable for improving mitigation and response actions of state and federal government to drought-affected regions in the future.},

This paper also investigates various models of measuring quality in higher education, consider their value and discuss both their shortcomings and contributions to the assessment of higher education institutions.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Comprehensive field campaigns dedicated to fog life cycle observation were conducted during the winters of 2010{\&}ndash;2013 at the SIRTA observatory in the suburb of Paris. In order to document their properties, in situ microphysical measurements collected during 23 fog events are examined here. They reveal large variability in number, concentration and size of both aerosol background before the fog onset and fog droplets according to the different cases. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact of aerosol particles on the fog microphysics. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} To derive an accurate estimation of the actual activated fog droplet number concentration {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}act{\textless}/i{\textgreater}, we determine the hygroscopicity parameter $\kappa$, the dry and the wet critical diameter and the critical supersaturation for each case by using an iterative procedure based on the $\kappa$-K{\"{o}}hler theory that combines cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), dry particle and droplet size distribution measurements. Resulting values of $\kappa$ = 0.17 ± 0.05 were found typical of continental aerosols. Our study reveals low values of the derived critical supersaturation with a median of 0.043 {\%} and large values for both wet and dry activation diameters. Consequently, the corresponding {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}act{\textless}/i{\textgreater} values are low with median concentrations of 53.5 cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and 111 cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} within the percentile 75th. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} No detectable trend between the concentration of aerosol particles with diameter {\textgreater} 200 nm and {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}act{\textless}/i{\textgreater} was observed. In contrast the CCN data at 0.1 {\%} supersaturation exhibits a strong correlation with these aerosol concentrations. We therefore conclude that the actual supersaturations reached during these fog episodes are too low and no simultaneous increase of aerosols {\textgreater} 200 nm and droplet concentrations can be observed. Moreover our analysis suggests that a high aerosol loading limits the supersaturation values. It is also found that the activated fraction mainly depends on the aerosol size while the hygroscopicity appears to be of a secondary importance. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Although radiative fogs are usually associated with higher aerosol loading rather than to stratus lowering events, our analysis reveals that the activated particle concentrations at the beginning of the event are similar for both types of fog. However the evolution of the droplet concentration during the fog life cycle shows significant differences between both types of fog.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Extreme weather related to heavy or more fre- quent precipitation events seem to be a likely possibility for the future of our planet. While precipitation measurements can be done by means of rain gauges, the obvious disad- vantages of point measurements are driving meteorologists towards remotely sensed precipitation methods. In South Africa more sophisticated and expensive nowcasting technol- ogy such as radar and lightning networks are available, sup- ported by a fairly dense rain gauge network of about 1500 daily gauges. In the rest of southern Africa rainfall mea- surements are more difficult to obtain. The local version of the Unified Model and the Meteosat Second Generation satellite data are ideal components of precipitation estima- tion in data sparse regions such as Africa. In South Africa hourly accumulations of the Hydroestimator (originally from NOAA/NESDIS) are currently used as a satellite based pre- cipitation estimator for the South African Flash Flood Guid- ance system, especially in regions which are not covered by radar. In this study the Hydroestimator and the stratiform rainfall field from the Unified Model are both bias corrected and then combined into a new precipitation field. The new product was tested over a two year period and provides a more accurate and comprehensive input to the Flash Flood Guidance systems in the data sparse southern Africa. Future work will include updating the period over which bias cor- rections were calculated.},

The resilience and coping mechanisms of communities affected by disasters have demonstrated the importance of local and traditional knowledge in the reduction of risk and the effects of hazards. This article aims to explore various initiatives for disaster risk reduction in South Africa undertaken by government departments and non-governmental organisations from 1994 to 2003. It describes the various methods and systems employed to reduce risk and vulnerability. A case study of the February 2000 floods in the Limpopo province of South Africa provides insight into local coping mechanisms and indigenous methods of risk reduction.},

Data from weather stations of the Hellenic National Meteorological Service (HNMS) indicated a mean yearly point frequency varying between 1 and 2 hail days for Central Macedonia. Crop insurance data from the Hellenic National Agricultural Insurance Organization (ELGA) showed a mean regional frequency of 22.3 hail days for the total cultivated area of Central Macedonia, about 6,500??km2, for the warm season, from April to September. Hailpad data representing almost one third of the total cultivated area of Central Macedonia, indicated a regional average of 8 hail days and 45 hailpads recording hail for the warm season. Spatial analysis over the hailpad area revealed a large variability of hail occurrence, with local maxima at the higher altitude and close to mountain barrier areas and a decreasing frequency over areas closer to the sea. The size distribution of a sample of 22,000 hailstones measured by the hailpads, showed a great majority, of 85.7{\%}, having diameters up to 11??mm. An inter-comparison of hail impact energies according to crop damaging potential indicated Central Macedonia hailfalls as the less intense compared to those of areas of Northern America. Application of the revised TORRO hail intensity scale extending to classes from H0 to H10, permitted a classification of Central Macedonia hailfalls appropriate for comparisons and correspondence between areas and countries about the severity and damaging of hailfalls. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Choosing statistical distance instead of geographical distance in interpolation of available coarse network observations to sites of a denser network, which is not reporting for the interpolation date, yields more robust interpolation results. The most distinct performance enhancement is in or close to mountainous terrain. Therefore, application of statistical distance in the inverse distance weighting interpolation or in similar methods can parsimoniously densify the currently available observation network. Additionally, the success further motivates search for conceptual rainorography interaction models as components of spatial rain interpolation algorithms in mountainous terrain.},

abstract = {Errors and uncertainty in radar estimates of precipitation result
both from errors in the basic measurement of reflectivity and from
attempts to relate this to the precipitation falling at the ground.
If radar data are to be used to their full potential, it is essential
that effective measures are taken to mitigate these problems. The
automatic processing of radar data that forms part of the UK Met.
Office's Nimrod system addresses a number of specific sources of
error. These include the identification and removal of spurious echoes
resulting from anomalous propagation of the radar beam, errors resulting
from variations in the vertical profile of reflectivity and radar
sensitivity errors. Routine verification of the surface precipitation
estimates has been undertaken, largely through comparison with rain
gauge observations, over a range of timescales, which has allowed
the benefits of the quality control and correction processes to be
quantified. Although the improvement derived varies according to
the dominant synoptic situation, an average reduction in the root-mean-square
difference between gauge and radar data of 30{\%} can be achieved. Copyright

abstract = {The accuracy with which vertical profiles of aerosol extinction can
be measured using routine Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program
(ARM) Climate Research Facility (ACRF) measurements and was assessed
using data from two airborne field campaigns, the ARM Aerosol Intensive
Operation Period (AIOP, May 2003), and the Aerosol Lidar Validation
Experiment (ALIVE, September 2005). This assessment pertains to the
aerosol at its ambient concentration and thermodynamic state (i.e.,
?) either free of or corrected for sampling artifacts) and includes
the following ACRF routine methods: Raman lidar, micropulse lidar
(MPL), and in situ aerosol profiles (IAP) with a small aircraft.
Profiles of aerosol optical depth ?), from which the profiles of
?) are derived through vertical differentiation, were measured by
the NASA Ames Airborne Tracking 14-channel Sun photometer (AATS-14);
these data were used as benchmark in this evaluation. The ACRF IAP
?ep(550 nm) were lower by 11{\%} (during AIOP) and higher by 1{\%} (during
ALIVE) when compared to AATS-14. The ACRF MPL ?(523 nm) measurements
were higher by 24{\%} (AIOP) and ?{\%} (ALIVE) compared to AATS-14, but
the correlation improved significantly during ALIVE. In the AIOP,
a second MPL operated by NASA showed a smaller positive bias (13{\%})
with respect to AATS-14. The ACRF Raman lidar ?(355 nm) measurements
were larger by 54{\%} (AIOP) and by 6{\%} (ALIVE) compared to AATS-14.
The large bias in the Raman lidar measurements during AIOP stemmed
from a gradual loss of Raman lidar sensitivity starting about the
end of 2001 going unnoticed until after AIOP. A major refurbishment
and upgrade of the instrument and improvements to a data processing
algorithm led to the significant improvement and very small bias
in ALIVE. Finally, we find that during ALIVE the Raman lidar water
vapor densities ?w are 8{\%} larger when compared to AATS-14, whereas
in situ measured ? aboard two different aircraft are smaller than
the AATS-14 values by 0.3?{\%}.},

abstract = {Spontaneous combustion of coal seams in the Witbank and Sasolburg coalfields, South Africa, was studied in order to determine if toxic chemical elements and compounds are being mobilised into the environment. Samples of the minerals forming on the surface of coal seams, and gases escaping from vents, were analysed to verify the presence of these elements and compounds. Gas temperature measurements at coal-fire vents range from 34 °C to 630 °C. The coal-fire gas minerals (CFGM) identified included sulphur compounds and salammoniac. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of CFGM by-products confirmed the presence of mascagnite ((NH4)2SO4), illite ((Al,Si)4O10[(OH)2,H2O]) letovicite ((NH4)3H(SO4)2), phlogopite (KMg3(AlSi3)O10(F,OH)2), titanium dioxide (TiO2), barite (BaSO4), iron sulphate (FeSO4), gypsum (CaSO4{\textperiodcentered}2H2O) and silicate. An unknown and unclassified sulphur-nitrogen-chlorine CFGM was also identified. The minerals are interpreted to have formed by condensation or sublimation; several may be alteration products. Other heavy elements found in the CFGM's are mercury, arsenic, lead, zinc, and copper. Arsenic and mercury were the major elements of potential environmental significance found accumulating around coal-fire vents. Relatively high concentrations of toluene, benzene and xylene were found in the gas collected at both Witbank and Sasolburg coalfields. Benzene, toluene and xylenes are known to possess carcinogenic proprieties. Thirty-two aliphatic compounds were detected, as well as halogenated compounds including bromomethane, iodomethane and trichloromethane in low concentrations, and dichloromethane and chloromethane in high concentrations. The highest concentrations of halogenated compounds were measured for gas samples from the Witbank coalfield. High concentrations of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane were also detected. The nature of the risks to human health and the environment of most of the compounds in gas and CFGM by-products of spontaneous combustion at the Witbank and Sasolburg coalfields are unknown and merit investigation. Fires caused by spontaneously combusted coal are pervasive in the coalfields and the health consequences of exposure to hazardous elements are a serious risk. It would be prudent to undertake an environmental impact assessment of these elements in order to determine the extent of their impact on mine workers and the environment in the Witbank and Sasolburg coalfields. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument on board the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite has been utilized for the first time in a study regarding lightning activity modulation due to aerosols. Lightning activity observations, obtained by the ZEUS long range Lightning Detection Network, European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) data and Cloud Fraction (CF) retrieved by MODIS on board Aqua satellite have been combined with CALIPSO CALIOP data over the Mediterranean basin and for the period March to November, from 2007 to 2014. The results indicate that lightning activity is enhanced during days characterized by higher Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) values, compared to days with no lightning. This study contributes to existing studies on the link between lightning activity and aerosols, which have been based just on columnar AOD satellite retrievals, by performing a deeper analysis into the effect of aerosol profiles and aerosol types. Correlation coefficients of R = 0.73 between the CALIPSO AOD and the number of lightning strikes detected by ZEUS and of R = 0.93 between ECMWF CAPE and lightning activity are obtained. The analysis of extinction coefficient values at 532 nm indicates that at an altitudinal range exists, between 1.1 km and 2.9 km, where the values for extinction coefficient of lightning-active and non-lightning-active cases are statistically significantly different. Finally, based on the CALIPSO aerosol subtype classification, we have investigated the aerosol conditions of lightning-active and non-lightning-active cases. According to the results polluted dust aerosols are more frequently observed during non-lightning-active days, while dust and smoke aerosols are more abundant in the atmosphere during the lightning-active days.},

abstract = {Particulate matter collected aboard the University of Washington's (UW) Convair-580 research aircrafi over southem Afiica during the dry biomass burning season was analyzed for total carbon (TC), organic carbon (OC), and black carbon (BC) contents using thermal and optical methods. Samples were collected in smoke plumes of burning savanna and in regional haze. A known artifact, produced by the adsorption of organic gases on the quartz filter substrates used to collect the particulate matter samples, comprised a significant portion of the TC collected. Consequently, conclusions derived from the data are greatly dependent on whether or not OC concentrations are corrected for this artifact. For example, the estimated aerosol coalbedo (1 - single scattering albedo (SSA)), which is a measure of aerosol absorption, of the biomass smoke samples is 60{\%} larger using corrected OC concentrations. Thus, the corrected data imply that the biomass smoke is 60{\%} more absorbing than do the uncorrected data. The BC to (corrected) OC mass ratio (BC/OC) of smoke plume samples (0.18 plus or minus 0.06) is lower than that of samples collected in the regional haze (0.25 plus or minus 0.08). The difference may be due to mixing of biomass smoke with background air characterized by a higher BC/OC ratio. A simple source apportionment indicates that biomass smoke contributes about three quarters of the aerosol burden in the regional haze, while other souxes (e.g., fossil fuel burning) contribute the remainder.},

@article{Creutin2003,
abstract = {Implementation of flood warning systems and community self-help programs is one of the most effective ways to mitigate the flash-flood risk. Inmany instances, these are the only affordable and sustainable mitigation approaches. Unfortunately, flash-flood warning is still hampered by changes in societal needs and by our limited knowledge of atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of this type of flood. On the one hand, flood warning has traditionally focused on localized targets for the protection of communities and for the management of hydraulic reservoirs. Given the general development of dispersed urbanization and transportation, and the expansion of green tourism and water sports in mountainous regions, human lives and property are increasingly exposed to flash-flood hazard in a scatteredmanner. This means that every river section of a monitored region can be considered as a potential target for flood warning. On the other hand, our poor knowledge of this phenomenon comes from the fact that, in most flash-flood cases, the rain accumulations and the discharges are simply unknown over most of the watersheds of concern. Flash floods develop at space and time scales that conventional observation systems of rain and discharge in rivers are not able to monitor. As these events are locally rare, they also escape the realm of field-based experimentation. Consequently, the atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of flash floods are poorly understood. Progress in flash-flood research is hampered by three main prob- lems: (i) the downscaling problem due to the incoherent space and time scales between atmospheric models and the flash-flood trigger- ing processes; (ii) the ungauged basin problem due to the fact that the small basins prone to flash-floods are seldom gauged and must be modelled without calibration; and (iii) the problem of knowing the limits of the soil retention control of runoff under the range of rain accumulations considered. Our view is that weather radar net- works deeply modify the flash flood monitoring problem. Combin- ing radar detection of rain and distributed hydrological modelling shows considerable potential for improving both the understanding of fundamental scientific questions, including extreme storms and runoff production mechanisms, and the ‘distributed' monitoring of the flash-flood hazard. This short commentary addresses some of these developments and identifies some new research needs in radar hydrology.},

abstract = {Previously, a method was developed to quantify Saharan dust optical
thickness and simultaneously diagnose the cloud-free longwave dust
direct radiative effect (LWDRE) over a single surface site using
observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager
(SEVIRI) and Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instrument
both flying on the Meteosat Second Generation series of satellites.
In this paper the overall utility of the approach is investigated
using a more comprehensive suite of observations, and the inherent
uncertainties associated with the method are assessed. On the basis
of these findings, the approach has been updated to account for the
effects of varying dust layer altitude. Comparisons with colocated
observations from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Multiangle
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) using the modified approach indicate
that the visible optical thickness at 0.55 $\mu$m, $\tau$055, can be obtained
with an RMS uncertainty of {\~{}}0.3 over North Africa and Arabia during
sunlit hours, while monthly maps of optical depth derived over this
region through spring and summer of 2006 show similar variability
to that identified in the long-term climatology provided by the Total
Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) Aerosol Index. The regional mean
instantaneous cloud-free LWDRE and associated LW radiative efficiency
estimated from GERB over the same period are relatively constant
with season, ranging from 9 to 11 W m−2 and 16–20 W m−2 $\tau$055−1, respectively.},

@article{zhang_2009b,
abstract = {As part 1 in a series of papers describing long-term simulations using
the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system and subsequent
process analyses and sensitivity simulations, this paper presents
a comprehensive model evaluation for the full year of 2001 over the
continental U.S. using both ground-based and satellite measurements.
CMAQ is assessed for its ability to reproduce concentrations and
long-term trends of major criteria pollutants such as surface ozone
(O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and related variables such
as indicator species, wet deposition fluxes, and column mass abundances
of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO2), tropospheric ozone
residuals (TORs), and aerosol optical depths (AODs). The domain-wide
and site-specific evaluation of surface predictions shows an overall
satisfactory performance in terms of normalized mean biases for annual
mean maximum 1 h and 8 h average O3 mixing ratios (?11.6 to 0.1{\%}
and ?4.6 to 3.0{\%}, respectively), 24 h average concentrations of
PM2.5 (4.2-35.3{\%}), sulfate (?13.0 to 43.5{\%}), and organic carbon
(OC) (?37.6 to 24.8{\%}), and wet deposition fluxes (?13.3 to 31.6{\%}).
Larger biases, however, occur in the concentrations and wet deposition
fluxes of ammonium and nitrate domain-wide and in the concentrations
of PM2.5, sulfate, black carbon, and OC at some urban/suburban sites.
The reasons for such model biases may be errors in emissions, chemistry,
aerosol processes, or meteorology. The evaluation of column mass
predictions shows a good model performance in capturing the seasonal
variations and magnitudes of column CO and NO2, but relatively poor
performance in reproducing observed spatial distributions and magnitudes
of TORs for winter and spring and those of AODs in all seasons. Possible
reasons for the poor column predictions include the underestimates
of emissions, inaccurate upper layer boundary conditions, lack of
model treatments of sea salt and dust, and limitations and uncertainties
in satellite data.},

abstract = {Sodar measurements have been used to estimate the mixing height for about 20 yr, nevertheless the issue is still the subject of controversial discussion. The paper attempts to critically examine the methods and results of mixing height determination from sodar data that have been reported in the literature. The theoretical base, the methods suggested, the automatization of algorithms, and the intercomparison of sodar-based mixing height values with data from independent measurements and models are briefly discussed. An assessment is given of sodar capabilities in comparison with other profiling techniques. It is concluded that sodar data may be used to derive reliable mixing height information in many situations which are of special relevance for environmental monitoring, namely in stagnant weather situations with low mixing height values between about 50 and 500-1000 m, depending on the type of the sodar. However, the algorithms available up to now for their automatic evaluation appear not yet reliable enough to be recommended for operational purposes, and a control of the output by a trained analyst is advisable. Simultaneous operation of sodars and other remote sensing systems (lidar, wind profiler) is shown to be a promising way to overcome the range limitations of sodars and to allow continuous mixing height estimation throughout the complete diurnal cycle.},

The information is valid for a 10-cm wavelength and consists of relations that are based on an extensive list of previous and recent observational and modeling studies of polarimetric signatures of hydrometeors. The relations are expressed as boundaries and thresholds in a space of polarimetric radar variables. Thus, the foundation is laid out for identification of hydrometeor types (species), estimation of characteristics of hydrometeor species (size, concentrations, etc.), and quantification of bulk hydrometeor contents (amounts). A fuzzy classification algorithm that builds upon this foundation will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.},

abstract = {Partitioning of major and trace components in PM10–PM2.5–PM1 at an urban site in Barcelona (Spain) in the Western Mediterranean was studied in the period 2005–2006. Particular attention was paid to the partitioning of mineral matter and to the evidence of possible interactions of mineral matter with other pollutants (gaseous pollutants and secondary PM). The results showed a high contribution of mineral matter (mainly anthropogenic, but sporadically associated with African dust outbreaks) in levels of both PM10 and PM2.5. A high proportion of nitrate was also present in the coarse fractions as a result of the interaction of mineral matter with gaseous pollutants. As at most urban sites in Europe, sulphate and carbonaceous aerosols are mainly present in the finer PM fractions. The PM1–2.5 fraction resembled that of PM10 in composition. The chemically unaccounted fraction (mostly bounded water) had also a fine grain size, probably because of the fine size of the hygroscopic aerosol components. The data series follow an increasing trend for PM1 levels (and less clearly for PM2.5) from 1999 to 2006, whereas no trend is observed for PM10. The contributions of African dust and regional soil resuspension to the annual PM10 levels has been estimated in around 1–2 and 2–3$\mu$gm−3 in this part of Spain. The African dust outbreaks accounted for around 15–20 exceedances of the European daily PM10 limit value. Finally, the data obtained were compared with data from selected European sites to highlight major differences in levels and speciation of PM.},

@article{fang_2009,
abstract = {While the export of pollutants from the United States exhibits notable
variability from day to day and is often considered to be “episodic,”
the contribution of strong daily export events to total export has
not been quantified. We use carbon monoxide (CO) as a tracer of anthropogenic
pollutants in the Model of OZone And Related Tracers (MOZART) to
estimate this contribution. We first identify the major export pathway
from the United States to be through the northeast boundary (24–48°N
along 67.5°W and 80–67.5°W along 48°N), and then analyze 15 summers
of daily CO export fluxes through this boundary. These daily CO export
fluxes have a nearly Gaussian distribution with a mean of 1100 Gg
CO day−1 and a standard deviation of 490 Gg CO day−1. To focus on
the synoptic variability, we define a “synoptic background” export
flux equal to the 15 day moving average export flux and classify
strong export days according to their fluxes relative to this background.
As expected from Gaussian statistics, 16{\%} of summer days are “strong
export days,” classified as those days when the CO export flux exceeds
the synoptic background by one standard deviation or more. Strong
export days contributes 25{\%} to the total export, a value determined
by the relative standard deviation of the CO flux distribution. Regressing
the anomalies of the CO export flux through the northeast U.S. boundary
relative to the synoptic background on the daily anomalies in the
surface pressure field (also relative to a 15 day running mean) suggests
that strong daily export fluxes are correlated with passages of midlatitude
cyclones over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The associated cyclonic
circulation and Warm Conveyor Belts (WCBs) that lift surface pollutants
over the northeastern United States have been shown previously to
be associated with long-range transport events. Comparison with observations
from the 2004 INTEX-NA field campaign confirms that our model captures
the observed enhancements in CO outflow and resolves the processes
associated with cyclone passages on strong export days. “Moderate
export days,” defined as days when the CO flux through the northeast
boundary exceeds the 15 day running mean by less than one standard
deviation, represent an additional 34{\%} of summer days and 40{\%} of
total export. These days are also associated with migratory midlatitude
cyclones. The remaining 35{\%} of total export occurs on “weak export
days” (50{\%} of summer days) when high pressure anomalies occur over
the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Our findings for summer also apply to
spring, when the U.S. pollutant export is typically strongest, with
similar contributions to total export and associated meteorology
on strong, moderate and weak export days. Although cyclone passages
are the primary driver for strong daily export events, export during
days without cyclone passages also makes a considerable contribution
to the total export and thereby to the global pollutant budget.},

Yet this information has not been readily accessible to the atmospheric chemistry community because it was scattered over a large number of publications and reported in numerous different units and reference systems. We have critically evaluated the presently available data and integrated these into a consistent format. On the basis of this analysis we present a set of emission factors for a large variety of species emitted from biomass fires. Where data were not available, we have proposed estimates based on appropriate extrapolation techniques. We have derived global estimates of pyrogenic emissions for important species emitted by the various types of biomass burning and compared our estimates with results from inverse modeling studies.},

abstract = {Aerosol particles from desert dust interact with clouds and influence climate on regional and global scales. The Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) aerosol campaign was initiated to study the effects of dust particles on cloud droplet nucleation and cloud properties. Here we report the results of individual-particle studies of samples that were collected from an aircraft in April 2007. We used analytical transmission electron microscopy, including energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, electron diffraction, and imaging techniques for the morphological, chemical, and structural characterization of the particles.Dust storms and regional background conditions were encountered during four days of sampling. Under dusty conditions, the coarse (supermicrometer) fraction resembles freshly crushed rock. The particles are almost exclusively mineral dust grains and include common rock-forming minerals, among which clay minerals, particularly smectites, are most abundant. Unaltered calcite grains also occur, indicating no significant atmospheric processing. The particles have no visible coatings but some contain traces of sulfur. The fine (submicrometer) fraction is dominated by particles of anthropogenic origin, primarily ammonium sulfate (with variable organic coating and some with soot inclusions) and combustion-derived particles (mostly soot). In addition, submicrometer, iron-bearing clay particles also occur, many of which are internally mixed with ammonium sulfate, soot, or both. We studied the relationships between the properties of the aerosol and the droplet microphysics of cumulus clouds that formed above the aerosol layer. Under dusty conditions, when a large concentration of coarse-fraction mineral particles was in the aerosol, cloud drop concentrations were lower and droplet diameters larger than under regional background conditions, when the aerosol was dominated by submicrometer sulfate particles. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {[1] The Meteorological Office C-130 aircraft performed a dedicated flight over the Etosha Pan surface-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Sun photometer site on 13 September 2000 during the Southern African Aerosol Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI 2000) intensive measurement campaign. Aerosol optical depths at different wavelengths, tau(aerlambda), are derived from in situ measurements of the scattering and absorption coefficients and from various radiometric measurements and compared to those derived from the Sun photometer site. The estimates of tau(aerlambda) from the various measurements are shown to be in good agreement. The exception to this is when tau(aerlambda) is derived from the Passive Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer Probe (PCASP), as this method is shown to be extremely sensitive to the pitch angle of the aircraft; therefore, tau(aerlambda) differs for profile ascents and profile descents. However, the aerosol size distribution measured by the PCASP and derived from the AERONET site are in excellent agreement over the 0.05-1.0 mum radius range, which contains the majority of the optically active particles. C-130-derived refractive indices and single scattering albedos are also shown to be in excellent agreement with those derived from the AERONET site. The consistency between in situ and remotely sensed data suggests that, for aerosol well mixed in the vertical, data from AERONET may be used with confidence in validating satellite measurements and modeling studies of the radiative properties and effects of aerosols.},

However, in an increasingly carbon constrained world and already now facing climate change impacts South Africa has to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity soon and decidedly. The South African electricity sector is a vital part of the economy and at the same time contributes most to the emissions problem. First steps have been taken by the South African government to enhance energy efficiency and promote renewable energy, however, they fail to show large-scale effects. This paper seeks to identify the relevant barriers to renewable energy investments and, based on experience from other countries, provide policy recommendations.The major barrier identified in the paper is based on the economics of renewable energy technologies, i.e. their cost and risk structures, two main factors in investment planning. As a solution, the South African government introduced several renewable energy support measures, such as a feed-in tariff. The paper discusses the potential and possible shortcomings of this and other existing support schemes and identifies complementing measures on a national scale. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Hygroscopic growth of aerosol particles at 85{\%} relative humidity and the number fraction of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN; 0.42{\%}, 0.23{\%}, and 0.10{\%} supersaturation) as a function of dry diameter (24.1{\&}{\#}8211;359 nm) were measured simultaneously on board R/V Hakuho-Maru over the western North Pacific during August{\&}{\#}8211;September 2008. Highly hygroscopic and unimodal growth distributions were observed, except for aerosols, which showed lower hygroscopic growth over the northern Pacific. The measured particle hygroscopicity, CCN activation diameters, and chemical composition data suggest the dominance of internally mixed sulfate aerosols. Backward air mass trajectory analysis exhibits an intrusion of free tropospheric aerosol, which was likely influenced by Kasatochi's volcanic plume and which was linked to the low-hygroscopicity event. Frequent observation of the Hoppel minimum suggests that in-cloud processing over the Pacific enhanced and/or maintained the high hygroscopicity of accumulation mode particles. The CCN activation diameters predicted from median hygroscopic growth factors (gmedian) agreed well with those determined from the CCN efficiency spectra, without assuming surface tension reduction caused by organics or enhancement of bulk hygroscopicity at high RH caused by sparingly soluble or polymeric compounds. The CCN spectra predicted from gmedian and measured CCN activation diameters suggest that the high CCN activities of particles over the North Pacific are sustained by high hygroscopicity, while sporadic changes of aerosol origins produce the diversity of the aerosol properties.},

abstract = {Stability indices provide simple metrics to characterize tropospheric states favouring convection. Not only for regions where precipitation is mainly related to convective processes, important aspects of the climate comprising information from different levels and variables can therefore be summarized in scalar metrics. Although the linkage between tropospheric stability and convective precipitation is blurred by additional prerequisites often not resolved in atmospheric models, analysis of stability indices from global climate models (GCMs) provides a more process-orientated assessment than the separate analysis of the individual climate variables. This paper presents an assessment of GCM capabilities to simulate tropospheric stability on the Arabian Peninsula. Therefore, six stability indices (K-Index, Total Totals Index, Vertical Totals Index, Showalter Index, SWEAT and Cross Totals Index) were calculated for several GCMs from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project 3 archive for three locations. GCM indices were compared with reanalysis data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction in collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric Research as well as radiosoundings from the Integrated Global Radiosounding Archive. Comparison was done by means of a classification approach based on quantile values of the index distribution. Input parameters of the indices were also analysed and biases for indices as well as input parameters were identified. There are biases found for the different indices which can be attributed to some extent to biases of the input parameters. There is no input parameter which is biased in the same direction for all indices and locations. Due to the variability of the results, rankings of the models are characterized by large rank differences so that there is no overall best performing model. Nevertheless, this study provides some insight in the performance of the GCMs to simulate tropospheric stability at individual locations and so presents an alternative method of model performance assessment.},

abstract = {Aerosol particles from desert dust interact with clouds and influence climate on regional and global scales. The Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) aerosol campaign was initiated to study the effects of dust particles on cloud droplet nucleation and cloud properties. Here we report the results of individual-particle studies of samples that were collected from an aircraft in April 2007. We used analytical transmission electron microscopy, including energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, electron diffraction, and imaging techniques for the morphological, chemical, and structural characterization of the particles.Dust storms and regional background conditions were encountered during four days of sampling. Under dusty conditions, the coarse (supermicrometer) fraction resembles freshly crushed rock. The particles are almost exclusively mineral dust grains and include common rock-forming minerals, among which clay minerals, particularly smectites, are most abundant. Unaltered calcite grains also occur, indicating no significant atmospheric processing. The particles have no visible coatings but some contain traces of sulfur. The fine (submicrometer) fraction is dominated by particles of anthropogenic origin, primarily ammonium sulfate (with variable organic coating and some with soot inclusions) and combustion-derived particles (mostly soot). In addition, submicrometer, iron-bearing clay particles also occur, many of which are internally mixed with ammonium sulfate, soot, or both. We studied the relationships between the properties of the aerosol and the droplet microphysics of cumulus clouds that formed above the aerosol layer. Under dusty conditions, when a large concentration of coarse-fraction mineral particles was in the aerosol, cloud drop concentrations were lower and droplet diameters larger than under regional background conditions, when the aerosol was dominated by submicrometer sulfate particles. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We present a constrained propagation of errors that tracks uncertainties from human activities to greenhouse gas emissions, to increasing abundances of greenhouse gases, to radiative forcing of climate, and finally to climate change, thus following the causal chain for greenhouse gases emitted by developed nations since national reporting began in 1990. Errors combine uncertainties in the forward modeling at each step with top-down constraints on the observed changes in greenhouse gases and temperatures. Global surface temperature increased by +0.11 °C in 2003 due to the developed nations' emissions of Kyoto greenhouse gases from 1990 to 2002. The uncertainty range, +0.08 °C to +0.14 °C (68{\%} confidence), is large considering that the developed countries emissions are well known for this period and climate system modeling uncertainties are constrained by observations.},

The primary aims of this investigation were to determine spatial and temporal distributions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3), as well as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) in this area. Sampling was conducted on a monthly basis for a year at eight strategically selected sites. The highest NO2, SO2 and BTEX concentrations were measured at sites with significant local sources and/or sites impacted by more remote sources, as indicated by overlay back trajectories. O3 concentrations were found to be lower at sites with high levels of NO2, SO2 and BTEX. NO2 and SO2 peaked during winter, while O3 peaked in spring. NO2 and SO2 temporal concentration variations were ascribed to differences in seasonal meteorological conditions, as well as additional sources in winter. The O3 peak coincided with a seasonal CO peak, which was identified as an important precursor for O3 formation. No distinct seasonal trend was observed for BTEX. The annual average concentrations for SO2, NO2, O3 and benzene were below the South African annual standards at all sites.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the status of forecasting convective precipitation
for time periods less than a few hours (nowcasting). Techniques for
nowcasting thunderstorm location were developed in the 1960s and
1970s by extrapolating radar echoes. The accuracy of these forecasts
generally decreases very rapidly during the first 30 min because
of the very short lifetime of individual convective cells. Fortunately
more organized features like squall lines and supercells can be successfully
extrapolated for longer time periods. Physical processes that dictate
the initiation and dissipation of convective storms are not necessarily
observable in the past history of a particular echo development;
rather, they are often controlled by boundary layer convergence features,
environmental vertical wind shear, and buoyancy. Thus, successful
forecasts of storm initiation depend on accurate specification of
the initial thermodynamic and kinematic fields with particular attention
to convergence lines. For these reasons the ability to improve on
simple extrapolation techniques had stagnated until the present national
observational network modernization program. The ability to observe
small-scale boundary layer convergence lines is now possible with
operational Doppler radars and satellite imagery. In addition, it
has been demonstrated that high-resolution wind retrievals can be
obtained from single Doppler radar. Two methods are presently under
development for using these modern datasets to forecast thunderstorm
evolution: knowledge-based expert systems and numerical forecasting
models that are initialized with radar data. Both these methods are
very promising and progressing rapidly. Operational tests of expert
systems are presently taking place in the United Kingdom and in the
United States.},

abstract = {The maximum spatial correlation technique (MASCOTTE) is an objective and$\backslash$nautomated method developed to simultaneously determine both the$\backslash$nstructural properties and evolution (tracking) of cloud shields of$\backslash$nconvective systems. Originally designed to monitor systems over the$\backslash$nAmazon region, this method has now been adapted for subtropical southern$\backslash$nAfrica. In this paper, a detailed climatology of 70 mesoscale convective$\backslash$ncomplexes (MCCs) that occurred during the austral summer months over$\backslash$nsouthern Africa during the 1998-2006 period are presented. Most MCCs are$\backslash$nclustered along the eastern regions of southern Africa, adjacent to the$\backslash$nwarm waters of the Mozambique Channel and Agulhas Current. A few$\backslash$ninfrequent systems are found to be developing in Namibia and Botswana.$\backslash$nThe systems are found to predominantly occur during the months of$\backslash$nNovember February, with maximum activity occurring in November and$\backslash$nDecember. The transition from a more midlatitude-dominated circulation$\backslash$nto a tropical circulation over the region during the late summer leads$\backslash$nto an uncharacteristic equatorward migration of the MCC distribution$\backslash$nthen. The analysis also suggests that there is variability in MCC$\backslash$nfrequency on monthly and seasonal time scales. Although fewer in number$\backslash$n(about nine per season) compared to MCC populations in other regions,$\backslash$nthe systems do tend to follow the nocturnal life cycle as documented$\backslash$nelsewhere.},

abstract = {A one-dimensional prognostic cloud model has been developed for possible use in a Cumulus Param-eterization Scheme (CPS). In this model, the nonhydrostatic pressure, entrainment, cloud microphysics, lateral eddy mixing and vertical eddy mixing are included, and their effects are discussed. The inclusion of the nonhydrostatic pressure can (1) weaken vertical velocities, (2) help the cloud de-velop sooner, (3) help maintain a longer mature stage, (4) produce a stronger overshooting cooling, and (5) approximately double the precipitation amount. The pressure perturbation consists of buoyancy pressure and dynamic pressure, and the simulation results show that both of them are important. We have compared our simulation results with those from Ogura and Takahashi's one-dimensional cloud model, and those from the three-dimensional Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. Our model, including detailed cloud microphysics, generates stronger maximum vertical velocity than Ogura and Takahashi's results. Furthermore, the results illustrate that this one-dimensional model is capable of reproducing the major features of a convective cloud that are produced by the three-dimensional model when there is no ambient wind shear.},

abstract = {Abstract Measurements of solar and infrared irradiance by instruments rigidly mounted to an aircraft have historically been plagued by the introduction of offsets and fluctuations into the data that are solely due to the pitch and roll movements of the aircraft. The Stabilized Radiometer Platform (STRAP) was developed to address this problem. Mounted on top of an aircraft and utilizing a self-contained, coupled Inertial Navigation System–GPS, STRAP actively keeps a set of uplooking radiometers horizontally level to within ±0.02° for aircraft pitch and roll angles of up to approximately ±10°. The system update rate of 100 Hz compensates for most pitch and roll changes experienced in normal flight and in turbulence. STRAP was mounted on a Twin Otter aircraft and its performance evaluated during normal flight and during a series of flight maneuvers designed to test the accuracy, range, and robustness of the platform. The measurements from an identical pair of solar pyranometers—one mounted on STRAP and the o...},

abstract = {The central theme of this paper is to describe how cloud system resolving models (CRMs) of grid spacing ?1 km have been applied to various important problems in atmospheric science across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales and how these applications relate to other modeling approaches. A long-standing problem concerns the representation of organized precipitating convective cloud systems in weather and climate models. Since CRMs resolve the mesoscale to large scales of motion (i.e., 10 km to global) they explicitly address the cloud system problem. By explicitly representing organized convection, CRMs bypass restrictive assumptions associated with convective parameterization such as the scale gap between cumulus and large-scale motion. Dynamical models provide insight into the physical mechanisms involved with scale interaction and convective organization. Multiscale CRMs simulate convective cloud systems in computational domains up to global and have been applied in place of contemporary convective parameterizations in global models. Multiscale CRMs pose a new challenge for model validation, which is met in an integrated approach involving CRMs, operational prediction systems, observational measurements, and dynamical models in a new international project: the Year of Tropical Convection, which has an emphasis on organized tropical convection and its global effects.},

Simulations are performed for a present climate of 30 years (1971–2000) using ERA40 and ECHAM5, and future climate is predicted for a period of 50 years (2021–2070) using ECHAM5 A1B emissions scenario. The results show that the spatial distribution of the present-day rainfall and temperature simulated by PRECIS are consistent with the observed dataset. In addition, their annual cycle and interannual variability are reasonably well reproduced. The dry precipitation and warm temperature biases exhibited in the driving fields (compared with the observations) are reduced because of the improvements in specific humidity and in the wind field within the PRECIS simulations compared with the driving fields. The projection using the calibrated national average temperature exhibits a positive trend in mean temperature of around 0.65 ◦C per decade. For rainfall projection, the results show that the coastal areas along the central parts of the Red Sea and the south-southwestern areas of Saudi Arabia may experience more extreme rainfall events, whereas the northern and central parts of the country may undergo a drying trend.},

The IFC method corrects the potential drift of the sensor offset at zero relative humidity, which is the critical parameter in determining the uncertainty of the measurements. The sensor offset is determined from the measurements themselves as obtained during periods when the aircraft is flying in the lower stratosphere at or above the hygropause, where the H2O mixing ratio reaches well-defined minimum values of about 5 ppmv and the contribution of atmospheric H2O to the sensor signal is minimal. The selection of stratospheric data is achieved with the help of potential temperature, which can be calculated in situ from measured temperature and pressure. The IFC method is capable of providing humidity measurements in near–real time with an uncertainty of ±8{\%} RH at the surface and ±7{\%} RH in the...},

In contrast to the previously reported global increase in lightning based on CTH, we find a 15{\%} decrease in total lightning flash rate with IFLUX in 2100 under a strong global warming scenario. Differences are largest in the tropics, where most lightning occurs, with implications for the estimation of future changes in tropospheric ozone and methane, as well as differences in their radiative forcings. These results suggest that lightning schemes more closely related to cloud ice and microphysical processes are needed to robustly estimate future changes in lightning and atmospheric composition.},

The target of this survey was a petrochemical plant in Linyan, Kaohsiung County, Taiwan. Samples were taken with canisters from 25 sites inside this plant, twice per season, and analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The survey covered 1 whole year. By consolidated into a database, the data could be readily retrieved, statistically analyzed, and clearly presented in both table and graph forms. It followed from the cross‐analysis of the database that the abundant types of VOCs were alkanes, alkenes/dienes, and aromatics, all of which accounted for 99{\%} of total VOCs. By contour plotting, the emission sources for alkanes, aromatics, and alkenes/dienes were successfully located. Through statistical analysis, the database could provide the range and 90{\%} confidence interval of each species from each emission source. Both alkanes a...},

abstract = {A method for the parameterization of ice-phase microphysics is proposed and used to develop a new bulk microphysics scheme. All ice-phase particles are represented by several physical properties that evolve freely in time and space. The scheme prognoses four ice mixing ratio variables, total mass, rime mass, rime volume, and number, allowing 4 degrees of freedom for representing the particle properties using a single category. This approach represents a significant departure from traditional microphysics schemes in which ice-phase hydrometeors are partitioned into various predefined categories (e.g., cloud ice, snow, and graupel) with prescribed characteristics. The liquid-phase component of the new scheme uses a standard two-moment, two-category approach. The proposed method and a complete description of the new predicted particle properties (P3) scheme are provided. Results from idealized model simulations of a two-dimensional squall line are presented that il-lustrate overall behavior of the scheme. Despite its use of a single ice-phase category, the scheme simulates a realistically wide range of particle characteristics in different regions of the squall line, consistent with observed ice particles in real squall lines. Sensitivity tests show that both the prediction of the rime mass fraction and the rime density are important for the simulation of the squall-line structure and precipitation.},

abstract = {The association between climate change and the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events is now well established. General circulation models of climate change predict that heatwaves will become more frequent and intense, especially in the higher latitudes, affecting large metropolitan areas that are not well adapted to them. Exposure to extreme heat is already a significant public health problem and the primary cause of weather-related mortality in the U.S. This article reviews major epidemiologic risk factors associated with mortality from extreme heat exposure and discusses future drivers of heat-related mortality, including a warming climate, the urban heat island effect, and an aging population. In addition, it considers critical areas of an effective public health response including heat response plans, the use of remote sensing and GIS methodologies, and the importance of effective communications strategies.},

abstract = {Abstract Both the spatial regression test (SRT) and inverse distance weighting (IDW) methods have been applied to provide estimates for the maximum air temperature (Tmax) and the minimum air temperature (Tmin) in the Applied Climate Information System (ACIS). This is critical to the processes of estimating missing data and identifying suspect data and is undertaken here to ensure quality data in ACIS. The SRT method was previously found to be superior to the IDW method; however, the sensitivity of the performance of both methods to input parameters has not been evaluated. A set of analyses is presented for both methods whereby the sensitivity to the radius of inclusion, the regression time window, the regression time offset, and the number of stations used to make the estimates are examined. Comparisons were also conducted between the SRT and the IDW methods. The performance of the SRT method stabilized when 10 or more stations were applied in the estimates.

abstract = {In this paper, outcomes from an investigation of plausible climate futures over the next century, and the potential impacts on water services including water resource management and disaster risk reduction, such as flash flooding in Ekurhuleni (EMM), are presented. Four key aspects are examined: (i) the extent to which the frequency of extreme rainfall events may change in South Africa as a result of climate change; (ii) the identification of some of the implications of extreme rainfall events for local government (iii) the identification of some of the challenges communities most at risk of flooding as a result of extreme rainfall events face, finally, (iv) the opportunities for future co-production of design methods and approaches to reduce current and future climate risks in EMM and elsewhere. Climate modelling conducted for this research indicates that it is plausible for an increase in the number of extreme rainfall events to occur over central and eastern South Africa over the next century. Over EMM, for example, an increase in extreme rainfall events is likely to be accompanied by flash flooding and a range of deleterious impacts, if planning and maintenance of the water services infrastructure is not improved – a result that is likely to be valid for all large metropolitan municipalities in the country. The paper provides some lessons learnt when trying to include a climate risk reduction approach into the planning of urban development.},

abstract = {In this study a set of 340 PM10 and PM2.5 samples collected throughout 16 months at rural, an urban kerbside and an industrial background site (affected by the emissions from the ceramic manufacture and other activities) were interpreted. On the regional scale, the main PM10 sources were mineral dust (mainly Al2O3, Fe, Ti, Sr, CaCO3, Mg, Mn and K), emissions derived from power generation (SO4=, V, Zn and Ni), vehicle exhausts (organic and elemental carbon, NO3- and trace elements) and marine aerosol (Na, Cl and Mg). The latter was not identified in PM2.5. At the industrial site, additional PM10 sources were identified (tile covering in the ceramic production, petrochemical emissions and bio-mass burning from a large orange tree cultivation area). The contribution of each PM source to PM10 and PM2.5 levels experiences significant variations depending on the type of PM episode (Local-urban mainly in autumn-winter, regional mainly in summer, African or Atlantic episode), which are discussed in this study. The results show that it would be very difficult to meet the EU limit values for PM10 established for 2010. The annual mean PM levels are 22.0 microg PM10/m3 at the rural and 49.5 microg PM10/m3 and 33.9 microg PM2.5/m3 at the urban site. The natural contribution in this region, estimated at 6 microg/m3 of natural mineral dust (resulting from the African events and natural resuspension) and 2 microg/m3 of marine aerosol, accounts for 40{\%} of the 2010 EU annual limit value (20 microg PM10/m3). Mineral dust concentrations at the urban and industrial sites are higher than those at the rural site because of the urban road dust and the ceramic-production contributions, respectively. At the urban site, the vehicle exhaust contribution (17 microg/m3) alone is very close to the 2010 EU PM10 limit value. At the rural site, the African dust is the main contributor to PM10 levels during the highest daily mean PM10 events (100th-97th percentile range). At the urban site, the vehicle exhaust product is the main contributor to PM10 and PM2.5 levels during the highest daily mean PM events (100th-85th percentile range). Mineral dust concentrations during African dust events accounts for 20-30 microg/m3 in PM10 and 10-15 microg/m3 in PM2.5. During non-African dust events, mineral dust derived from anthropogenic activities (e.g. urban road dust) is also a significant contributor to PM10, but not to PM2.5.},

WHO and UNEP created an air pollution monitoring network as part of the Global Environment Monitoring System. This network now covers over 50 cities in 35 developing and developed countries throughout the world. The analyses of the data reported by the network over the past 15–20 yr indicate that the lessons of the prior experiences in the developed countries (U.S.A., U.K.) have not been learned. A study of air pollution in 20 of the 24 megacities of the world (over 10 million people by year 2000) shows that ambient air pollution concentrations are at levels where serious health effects are reported. The expected rise of population in the next century, mainly in the developing countries with a lack of capital for air pollution control, means that there is a great potential that conditions will worsen in many more cities that will reach megacity status. This paper maps the potential for air pollution that cities will experience in the future unless control strategies are developed and implemented during the next several decades.},

abstract = {The area of Gela (Sicily, Italy) contains one of the largest petroleum refineries in Europe and also has several oil fields both on land and offshore. This paper discusses how the oil refinery and traffic-related air pollution affect the chemical composition of airborne particulate matter over the town of Gela, using pine needles and urban road dust as the means of survey. Forty-one samples of pine needles from Pinus halepensis (Mill.) and two composite samples of roadway dust, each subdivided into six size fractions, were analyzed for major and trace elements. Information on the natural or anthropogenic origin of the observed heavy metals was deduced from factor analysis and element distribution maps. Factor analysis was applied to a data set of 20 element concentrations in pine needles and identified three main sources of metals: soil, vehicle traffic, and industrial emissions. The petrochemical plant appears to be associated with raised levels of As, Mo, Ni, S, Se, V, and Zn. Similarly, enhanced Cu, Pb, Pt, Pd, Sb, and partly Zn concentrations are closely associated with traffic. High correlations between Ni and V, As and Se, and Pb and Sb were observed. Element distribution maps, showing a decrease in heavy metal contents immediately farther inland, confirm that local sources play a considerable role in heavy metal pollution. Morphological alterations and accumulation of phenols were observed in sections of Pinus halepensis needles collected from sites with high traffic density and industrial emissions.},

abstract = {This paper offers a critical review of the topic of cloud–climate feedbacks and exposes some of the underlying reasons for the inherent lack of understanding of these feedbacks and why progress might be expected on this important climate problem in the coming decade. Although many processes and related parameters come under the influence of clouds, it is argued that atmospheric processes fundamentally govern the cloud feedbacks via the relationship between the atmospheric circulations, cloudiness, and the radiative and latent heating of the atmosphere. It is also shown how perturbations to the atmospheric radiation budget that are induced by cloud changes in response to climate forcing dictate the eventual response of the global-mean hydrological cycle of the climate model to climate forcing. This suggests that cloud feedbacks are likely to control the bulk precipitation efficiency and associated responses of the planet's hydrological cycle to climate radiative forcings. The paper provides a brief overview of the effects of clouds on the radiation budget of the earth– atmosphere system and a review of cloud feedbacks as they have been defined in simple systems, one being a system in radiative–convective equilibrium (RCE) and others relating to simple feedback ideas that regulate tropical SSTs. The systems perspective is reviewed as it has served as the basis for most feedback analyses. What emerges is the importance of being clear about the definition of the system. It is shown how different assumptions about the system produce very different conclusions about the magnitude and sign of feedbacks. Much more diligence is called for in terms of defining the system and justifying assumptions. In principle, there is also neither any theoretical basis to justify the system that defines feedbacks in terms of global–time-mean changes in surface temperature nor is there any compelling empirical evidence to do so. The lack of maturity of feedback analysis methods also suggests that progress in understanding climate feedback will require development of alternative methods of analysis. It has been argued that, in view of the complex nature of the climate system, and the cumbersome problems encountered in diagnosing feedbacks, understanding cloud feedback will be gleaned neither from observations nor proved from simple theoretical argument alone. The blueprint for progress must follow a more arduous path that requires a carefully orchestrated and systematic combination of model and obser-vations. Models provide the tool for diagnosing processes and quantifying feedbacks while observations provide the essential test of the model's credibility in representing these processes. While GCM climate and NWP models represent the most complete description of all the interactions between the processes that presumably establish the main cloud feedbacks, the weak link in the use of these models lies in the cloud parameterization imbedded in them. Aspects of these parameterizations remain worrisome, containing levels of empiricism and assumptions that are hard to evaluate with current global observations. Clearly observationally based methods for evaluating cloud parameterizations are an important element in the road map to progress. Although progress in understanding the cloud feedback problem has been slow and confused by past analysis, there are legitimate reasons outlined in the paper that give hope for real progress in the future.},

abstract = {Improvement of energy efficiency has been accepted as one of the most cost-effective approaches towards sustainable economic development and reduction of the continuously increasing energy consumption internationally. South Africa, being among the developing countries, is not an exception even though historically low energy prices and the lack of appropriate policies have created an energy intensive economy. This paper examines the factors affecting the trends in energy efficiency in South Africa from 1993 to 2006 and particularly the impact of structural changes and utilisation efficiency of the country's energy intensity. Identifying and understanding the driving forces are necessary ingredients in the development of appropriate policy-making. This paper also provides disaggregation of the energy efficiency trends in the main sectors of the economy. We determine that structural changes of the economy have played an important and negative role in the increasing economy-wide energy efficiency. On the other hand, the energy usage's intensity was a contributing factor to the decreasing trend of energy efficiency. We suggest that differentiated price policies may be required if South Africa is to create an effective energy efficiency policy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Fine laminar structures in the atmosphere have been described previously,
but their characterization has been limited. The modern global coverage
of aircraft flights offers an opportunity to provide such a characterization,
and examine the ubiquity of such structures, in space and time. Research
aircraft measuring vertical profiles of atmospheric chemical constituents
frequently discern quasi-horizontal atmospheric layers with mean
thicknesses of the order of 1 km and mean altitudes between 5 and
7 km. These layers can be characterized and categorized by various
combinations of ozone, water vapour, carbon monoxide and methane
deviations from background profiles. Five commercial aircraft have
been recently equipped to measure water vapour and ozone concentrations,
and automatically collect vertical profile information on landing
and take-off. Here we synthesize measurements from both research
and commercial flights and demonstrate the ubiquity in space and
time of four layer types (as categorized by their chemical signatures).
Up to one-fifth of the lowest 12 km of the atmosphere is occupied
by such layers. We suggest that this universality reflects basic
characteristics of the atmosphere hitherto unexplored, with potential
implications for present understanding of a wide variety of dynamic
and chemical atmospheric processes.},

One contentious issue has been the relationship between the evaluations and learning. If good instruction increases the amount of learning that takes place, then learning and the evaluations should be validly related to each other. A review of the literature shows that attempts to find such a nomological relationship has been complicated by practice, methodology, and interpretation. A meta-analysis of the literature shows that a small average relationship exists between learning and the evaluations but that the association is situational and not applicable to all teachers, academic disciplines, or levels of instruction.

The record of coincident, suborbital validation data has also increased steadily, making it possible to progressively improve the satellite retrieval algorithms, and in particular, the constraints on aerosol type. We have focused on refining the aerosol products, as well as applying them toward better representing wildfire smoke, desert dust, volcanic ash, and urban pollution in climate models.

abstract = {A forecaster-interactive capability was added to an automated convective storm nowcasting system [Auto- Nowcaster (ANC)] to allow forecasters to enhance the performance of 1-h nowcasts of convective storm initiation and evolution produced every 6 min. This Forecaster-Over-The-Loop (FOTL-ANC) system was tested at the National Weather Service Fort Worth–Dallas, Texas, Weather Forecast Office during daily operations from 2005 to 2010. The forecaster's role was to enter the locations of surface convergence boundaries into the ANC prior to dissemination of nowcasts to the Center Weather Service Unit. Verification of the FOTL-ANC versus ANC (no human) nowcasts was conducted on the convective scale. Categorical verification scores were computed for 30 subdomains within the forecast domain. Special focus was placed on subdomains that included convergence boundaries for evaluation of forecaster involvement and impact on the FOTL-ANC nowcasts. The probability of detection of convective storms increased by 20{\%}–60{\%} with little to no change observed in the false-alarm ratios. Bias values increased from 0.8–1.0 to 1.0–3.0 with human involvement. The accuracy of storm nowcasts notably improved with forecaster involvement; critical success index (CSI) values increased from 0.15–0.25 (ANC) to 0.2–0.4 (FOTL-ANC). Over short time periods, CSI values as large as 0.6 were also observed. This study demonstrated definitively that forecaster involvement led to positive improvement in the nowcasts in most cases while causing no degradation in other cases; a few exceptions are noted. Results show that forecasters can play an important role in the production of rapidly updated, convective storm nowcasts for end users.},

Eight regions covering the whole territory were defined based on the correlation of the mean annual hail frequency between all weather stations. Regions lying between 30?? and 40??S as well as those dominated by mountains present the highest hail frequencies in Argentina. The eastern and coastal areas of the country experience hail events mainly during springtime but they may start in late winter and continue through the beginning of summer. Events in western and central Argentina also predominate in spring but the maximum frequencies are observed during summer months. Trends in the annual number of hail events calculated for each region indicate that events in northwestern and northeastern Argentina have been increasing as well as in southern Patagonia. On the other hand, in central Argentina, southern Buenos Aires-La Pampa, northern Buenos Aires-Litoral and northern Patagonia trends are negative and statistically significant in the first two regions, basically by the decrease of events during spring and summer. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {From 1997 to 2003, airborne measurements of O3, CO, SO2, and aerosol properties were made during summertime air pollution episodes over the mid-Atlantic United States (34.7–44.6°N, 68.4–81.6°W) as part of the Regional Atmospheric Measurement, Modeling, and Prediction Program (RAMMPP). Little diurnal variation was identified in the CO, SO2, and {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m exponent profiles, although the {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m exponent profiles decreased with altitude. Boundary layer O3 was greater in the afternoon, while lower free tropospheric O3 was invariant at ∼55 ppbv. The single scattering albedo increased from morning to afternoon (0.93 ± 0.01–0.94 ± 0.01); however, both profiles decreased with altitude. A cluster analysis of back trajectories in conjunction with the vertical profile data was used to identify source regions and characteristic transport patterns during summertime pollution episodes. When the greatest trajectory density lay over the northern Ohio River Valley, the result was large O3 values, large SO2/CO ratios, highly scattering particles, and large aerosol optical depths. Maximum trajectory density over the southern Ohio River Valley resulted in little pollution. The greatest afternoon O3 values occurred during periods of stagnation. North-northwesterly and northerly flow brought the least pollution overall. The contribution of regional transport to afternoon boundary layer O3 was quantified. When the greatest cluster trajectory density lay over the Ohio River Valley (∼59{\%} of the profiles), transport accounted for 69–82{\%} of the afternoon boundary layer O3. Under stagnant conditions (∼27{\%} of the profiles), transport only accounted for 58{\%} of the afternoon boundary layer O3. The results from this study provide a description of regional chemical and transport processes that will be valuable to investigators from the Baltimore, New York, and Pittsburgh EPA Supersites.},

abstract = {Aerosol-cloud interaction is recognized as one of the key factors influencing cloud properties and precipitation regimes across local, regional, and global scales and remains one of the largest uncertainties in understanding and projecting future climate changes. Deep convective clouds (DCCs) play a crucial role in the general circulation, energy balance, and hydrological cycle of our climate system. The complex aerosol-DCC interactions continue to be puzzling as more ‘‘aerosol effects'' unfold, and systematic assessment of such effects is lacking. Here we systematically assess the aerosol effects on isolated DCCs based on cloud-resolving model simulations with spectral bin cloud microphysics. We find a dominant role of vertical wind shear in regulating aerosol effects on isolated DCCs, i.e., vertical wind shear qualitatively determines whether aerosols suppress or enhance convective strength. Increasing aerosols always suppresses convection under strong wind shear and invigorates convection under weak wind shear until this effect saturates at an optimal aerosol loading. We also found that the decreasing rate of convective strength is greater in the humid air than that in the dry air when wind shear is strong. Our findings may resolve some of the seemingly contradictory results among past studies by considering the dominant effect of wind shear. Our results can provide the insights to better parameterize aerosol effects on convection by adding the factor of wind shear to the entrainment term, which could reduce uncertainties associated with aerosol effects on climate forcing.},

abstract = {Existing research on climate change planning has tended to adopt an overly simplistic approach to analyzing how agency and structure mediate local governments' responses to climate change. This research contributes to scientific capacity to predict and explain patterns of climate change planning by focusing on the concept of legitimacy and examining its influence upon the dialectic between structure and agency. A conceptual framework foregrounding legitimacy is developed based upon new institutional theory. An initiative to institutionalize climate change planning in Aarhus Municipality, Denmark, is used as a case study to validate four propositions derived from existing research but filtered through the conceptual framework. Validation of the propositions evidences a hierarchy in the salience of different forms of legitimacy, with moral and ethical arguments for undertaking climate change planning having limited social traction in Denmark in the absence of significant extreme climatic events. The analysis also generates thicker, more nuanced explanations for real-world patterns of climate change planning. The findings thereby provide a corrective to a number of assertions made in the literature, notably in relation to the role of agency in the institutionalization of climate change planning. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In the present study, the locally measured EFs of particulate matter (PM), organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC) for solid fuels burned in the residential sector are compiled and compared. These fuels are classified into seven sub-groups of anthracite briquette, anthracite chunk, bituminous briquette, bituminous chunk, crop residue, fuel wood log, and brushwood/branches. The EFs of carbonaceous particles for these fuels vary significantly, generally in the order of anthracite (briquette and chunk){\textless}wood log{\textless}brushwood/branches{\textless}crop residue{\textless}bituminous (briquette and chunk), with an exception that the brushwood/branches have a relatively high EF of EC. The ratio of EC/OC varies significantly among different fuels, and is generally higher for biomass fuel than that for coal because of the intense flaming conditions formed during the biomass burning process in improved stoves. Distinct ratios calls for a future study on the potential health and climate impacts of carbonaceous PM from the residential combustions of different fuels. A narrow classification of these fuels significantly reduces the variations in the EFs of PM, OC, and EC, and the temporal and geographical distributions of the emissions could be better characterized. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study investigates whether any evidence can be found to support the occurrence of alterations in the hailstorm frequency in the last few decades (1978-2009) over Germany and Europe. Due to their local-scale extent and a lack of appropriate monitoring systems, hailstorms are not captured reliably and comprehensively over long periods by current observation systems. To overcome this constraint, we consider various convective indices and parameters (CPs) derived from soundings at 1200 UTC, and we evaluate which of them are appropriate for predicting hail damage days according to loss data from a building insurance company. Most of the CPs that rely on moisture at the near-surface layers exhibit a significant positive trend towards a higher convective potential. This finding applies to the 90{\%} (10{\%}) percentiles of the annual distribution and to the number of days that exceed (or fall below) a specific threshold, which is suitable for hailstorm prediction. Negative and, at most stations, insignificant trends of CPs that rely on moisture at higher levels or if the initial parameters of the lifting curve were mixed over the lowest layers can be attributed to inconsistency in the time series of the dew point. This in homogeneity is caused by changes in the instrumentation around the year 1990. The investigations show considerable spatial differences in the convective potential both in the mean and the trends, with a distinct north-to-south gradient and a less marked west-to-east gradient over Europe and Germany. The spatial distribution of the trends, however, is fairly consistent among the CPs that are based on the same principles. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study provides a very clear picture of the microphysics and flow field in a convective storm in the Rondonia region of Brazil through a synthesis of observations from two unique radars, measurements of the surface drop size distribution (DSD), and particle types and sizes from an aircraft penetration. The primary findings are 1) the growth of rain by the collision–coalescence–breakup (CCB) process to equilibrium drop size distributions entirely below the 08C level; 2) the subsequent growth of larger ice particles (graupel and hail) at subfreezing temperatures; 3) the paucity of lightning activity during the former process, and the increased lightning frequency during the latter; 4) the occurrence of strong downdrafts and a downburst during the latter phase of the storm resulting from cooling by melting and evaporation; 5) the occurrence of turbulence along the main streamlines of the storm; and 6) the confirmation of the large drops reached during the CCB growth by polarimetric radar observations. These interpretations have been made possible by estimating the updraft magnitude using the ‘‘lower bound'' of the Doppler spectrum at vertical incidence, and identifying the ‘‘balance level'' at which particles are supported for growth. The combination of these methods shows where raindrops are supported for extended periods to allow their growth to equilibrium drop size distributions, while smaller drops ascend and large ones descend. A hypothesis worthy of pursuit is the control of the storm motion by the winds at the balance level, which is the effective precipitation generating level. Above the 08C level the balance level separates the small ascending ice crystals from the large descending graupel and hail. Collisions between the two cause electrical charging, while gravity and the updrafts separate the charges to cause lightning. Below the 08C level, large downward velocities (caused by the above-mentioned cooling) in excess of the terminal fall speeds of raindrops represent the downbursts, which are manifested in the surface winds.},

abstract = {Successful seeding of clouds in weather modification experiments essentially depends on the seeding time and dynamics, amount of seeding material and location of the initial seeding area. In the present study, we focus on the influence of the initial seeding zone location on the transport of seeding agent material into the target cloud. In addition, the inadvertent transport of seeding material is analysed. During weather modification activities, a lot of seeding material can be transferred far from the seeding zone in a downwind direction. The primary motivation for this research was to prove this statement. We use a three-dimensional, mesoscale cloud-resolving model to achieve our goal. We performed sensitivity tests with respect to the distance between the mass centres of the initial seeding area and the cloud. Different seeding scenarios are analysed. Our principal findings are as follows: (1) For distances between the mass centres of the initial seeding area and the cloud below 2.5km, all seeding agent material would be activated after a short time. For distances above 10 km, most of the seeding agent would remain inactivated, because horizontal transport of the seeding agent becomes more important than transport induced by the main updraft. For these scenarios, the seeding agent is injected in the cold peripheral part of the cloud. (2) Sensitivity tests show that the inactivated seeding agent would remain close to the seeding area if the seeding is performed below cloud base. This effect occurs even for large distances between the seeding area and the target cloud ({\textgreater}20 km) due to low-level convergence. Thus, this seeding method suppresses the inert seeding material from being transferred far from the seeding zone. (3) The complete seeding material stays inactivated if the seeding is performed between the −8 and −12°C isotherms in front of the increased reflectivity zone. As a consequence, it would be transferred far from its initial area. The cloud would not be able to capture the seeding agent even during its greatest lateral extent.},

abstract = {The concentration of hail damage over a very few days of each warm season is a main characteristic of hail climatology in Southwestern France. The hailpad networks set up there in 1988 by the ANELFA hail prevention project have allowed the development of a new extreme hail day climatology which consists in examining the hail day data in the Atlantic region mainly under maritime conditions, and in the Pyrenean region, under continental and mountain influences. A pyramidal representation of each daily mean hailfall parameter (frequency per station, kinetic energy per hailfall, and kinetic energy per station), ranked by order of magnitude, allows a comparison of the mean and extreme values in the two regions, and reveals the strongest hail days in each one. During the 23-year period under study, 13 extreme situations (7 in the Atlantic region, 6 in the Pyrenean one) are highlighted, keeping the first three day ranking for each parameter. For each day, the synoptic situation, cell type, storm trajectories, and hail damages are examined, and numerical simulations with the WRF model, initialized by the CDAS/NCEP-NCAR reanalysis program, are considered. The study confirms that the Pyrenean region (20,000km2) has experienced the major hail situations, with record values of each parameter for the two regions. On the frequency record day (16 April 2007), 17{\%} of the hailpad stations were impacted, and on the kinetic energy record day (16 July 2009), the total hailstone energy reached 33J/m2 per station. Two main types of synoptic situations have been identified according to the location of the pressure low generating the upper level flow, either near Portugal or near Ireland. A third type, with the pressure low above the Mediterranean, has been observed only once. The WRF-NMM simulations show that all the severe hailstorms that occurred in the twelve situations (one situation is common to both regions) developed in the areas where the mesoscale environment was characterized by a strong dynamical forcing and by high values of the low-level and deep shears. After calibration with this sample of extreme hail days, the WRF model appears promising for severe hail forecasting. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Airborne measurements made on initial smoke from 10 savanna fires in southern Africa provide quantitative data on emissions of 50 gaseous and particulate species, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, methane, ammonia, dimethyl sulfide, nonmethane organic compounds, halocarbons, gaseous organic acids, aerosol ionic components, carbonaceous aerosols, and condensation nuclei (CN). Measurements of several of the gaseous species by gas chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are compared. Emission ratios and emission factors are given for eight species that have not been reported previously for biomass burning of savanna in southern Africa (namely, dimethyl sulfide, methyl nitrate, five hydrocarbons, and particles with diameters from 0.1 to 3 microns). The emission factor that we measured for ammonia is lower by a factor of 4, and the emission factors for formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and CN are greater by factors of about 3, 20, and 3 - 15, respectively, than previously reported values. The new emission factors are used to estimate annual emissions of these species from savanna fires in Africa and worldwide.},

abstract = {A continuous ambient automobile pollution monitoring programme was initiated in the Johannesburg region in May 1982 and shows that automobile pollution levels which give rise to photochemical smog have slowly increased since this date. Non-methane hydrocarbons in the city centre exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) standard for more than 50{\%} of the time. Downwind of the city centre, ozone hourly averages have exceeded the USEPA standard on 8 days during the 1984/85 season. In comparison, ozone concentrations of the Sydney region exceeded the USEPA standard on 7 days during the wet 1983/84 season (NSW, 1984). From site comparisons it is found that O3 data are very similar at out of town stations. It is concluded that these results only arise because the O3 is formed in a well-mixed layer over the region, leading to a high degree of correlation between O3 peaks.},

abstract = {Recent publications suggest that anthropogenic aerosols suppress$\backslash$norographic precipitation in California and elsewhere. A field campaign$\backslash$n(SUPRECIP: Suppression of Precipitation) was conducted to investigate$\backslash$nthis hypothesized aerosol effect. The campaign consisted of in situ$\backslash$naircraft measurements of the polluting aerosols, the composition of the$\backslash$nclouds ingesting them, and the way the precipitation-forming processes$\backslash$nare affected. SUPRECIP was conducted during February and March of 2005$\backslash$nand February and March of 2006. The flights documented the aerosols and$\backslash$norographic clouds flowing into the central Sierra Nevada from the upwind$\backslash$ndensely populated industrialized/urbanized areas and contrasted them$\backslash$nwith the aerosols and clouds downwind of the sparsely populated areas in$\backslash$nthe northern Sierra Nevada. SUPRECIP found that the aerosols transported$\backslash$nfrom the coastal regions are augmented greatly by local sources in the$\backslash$nCentral Valley resulting in high concentrations of aerosols in the$\backslash$neastern parts of the Central Valley and the Sierra foothills. This$\backslash$npattern is consistent with the detected patterns of suppressed$\backslash$norographic precipitation, occurring primarily in the southern and$\backslash$ncentral Sierra Nevada, but not in the north. The precipitation$\backslash$nsuppression occurs mainly in the orographic clouds that are triggered$\backslash$nfrom the boundary layer over the foothills and propagate over the$\backslash$nmountains. The elevated orographic clouds that form at the crest are$\backslash$nminimally affected. The clouds are affected mainly during the second$\backslash$nhalf of the day and the subsequent evening, when solar heating mixes the$\backslash$nboundary layer up to cloud bases.

abstract = {In this paper an approach is described to improve weather radar estimates of rainfall based on a neural network technique. Other than rain gauges which measure the rain rate R directly on the ground, the weather radar measures the reflectivity Z aloft and the rain rate has to be determined over a Z - R relationship. Besides the fact that the rain rate has to be estimated from the reflectivity many other sources of possible errors are inherent to the radar system. In other words the radar measurements contain an amount of observation noise which makes it a demanding task to train the network properly. A feed-forward neural network with Z values as input vector was trained to predict the rain rate R on the ground. The results indicate that the model is able to generalize and the determined input-output relationship is also representative for other sites nearby with similar conditions. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract Finite systems of deterministic ordinary nonlinear differential equations may be designed to represent forced dissipative hydrodynamic flow. Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.},

abstract = {Sun photometers that use light-emitting diode (LED) detectors in place of optical interference filters and photo diodes have significant potential advantages, including low cost, durability, and long-term optical stability. However, their relatively wide spectral response bandwidth poses some challenges in calibration and interpretation. Analysis of LED-based Sun photometers developed for the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program has demonstrated that such instruments can, in fact, be calibrated using the standard Langley plot method and that their performance can be described in terms of effective response wavelengths. Several GLOBE Sun photometers have been calibrated at Mauna Loa Observatory on two separate occasions. The derived extraterrestrial constants are essentially the same in spite of the fact that the calibrations were performed under significantly different atmospheric conditions. These reference instruments have been used to transfer calibrations to other optically and electronically identical Sun photometers, thereby making it possible to establish a large network of inexpensive LED-based Sun photometers. Data collected by students at a GLOBE high school near NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and compared against aerosol optical thickness measurements from Sun photometers at GSFC demonstrate both that students can reliably make the required measurements and that LED-based Sun photometers give results that compare favorably with conventional filter-based instruments, even though their optical properties are significantly different.

abstract = {The last national hail climatology of Canada was based upon the 1951-80 time period. However, from 1977 to 1993, many more stations reported days with hail than prior to 1977. As a result, a more spatially detailed analysis is now possible. Unfortunately, after 1993 the observing network began to be replaced by automatic stations that do not report hail, and therefore a mesoscale analysis can only effectively use the time period of 1977-1993. Due to the fact that ice pellets have often been recorded as hail, this analysis restricted itself to the warm months of May to September. The current national hail climatology is broadly similar to the previous one (with a few notable differences) but is much richer in spatial detail. The highest hail frequencies occur in interior British Columbia and Alberta. Topography appears to be a significant control on patterns of hail occurrence.},

abstract = {The statistical relationships among the various 10°-70°E mid-latitude blocking anticyclone parameters and the weather of the Arabian Peninsula (AP) (35°-60°E, 12°-32°N) over a 40-year period (1968-2007), on seasonal, interannual, decadal and long-term scales, are studied. The studied parameters include the number of blocking anticyclone events, the duration, the intensity, and the longitude at the blocking anticyclone onset. It is found that 31{\%} of the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude blocking anticyclone events occurred over the 10°-70°E longitudes, and out of these, the maximum number of mid-latitude blocking anticyclone event onsets are at 30°E (24{\%}). On the seasonal basis, the annual and decadal relationships of the 10°-70° blocking anticyclones with the El-Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) indices are presented. The results show that the number of days the blocking anticyclones persists is sensitive to the ENSO phase. The mid-latitude blocking anticyclone occurrence over the 10°-70°E longitudes is indicative of the reduced surface temperature variance, both upstream and downstream, during the blocking anticyclone period, over the AP. A shift in the mean surface temperature distribution occurs, in all seasons, during the blocking anticyclone period. The blocking anticyclones initiate a surface temperature change (both positive and negative) that persists even after the blocking anticyclone's decay. The AP surface weather during the months of October, November, and December is affected more by the occurrence of mid-latitude blocking anticyclones over the 10°-70°E longitudes in the presence the of El-Ni{\~{n}}o phase. {\textcopyright} 2012 Royal Meteorological Society.},

An objective technique for locating instances of cyclone formation, intensification, maturation, and decay is applied to a 7-year dataset of SH cyclone positions, obtained from an automated finding and tracking scheme based on twice-daily ECMWF analyses during 1980–86. Geostrophic vorticity $\zeta$g at 1000 hPa is used to locate cyclones and determine their intensity. Cyclones form and develop within middle latitudes and migrate eastward and poleward during their lives. Preferred genesis and cyclogenesis regions include eastern coasts of Australia and South America in winter, and leeward of the Andes and near the baroclinic zones associated with the principal upper-tropospheric jet streams year round. Over open water, winter cyclones tend to form and intensify near zones of strongest SST gradient.

The BVOCs are estimated to total 80 Tg C yr(-1) for the region, with isoprene and monoterpenes contributing 56 and 7 Tg C yr(-1), respectively. The large uncertainties, particularly in terms of basal emission capacity assignment, associated with these outputs are discussed. Woodlands are predicted to be the dominant vegetation type, covering 23{\%} of southern Africa, and are the largest annual source of isoprene 20 Tg C), monoterpenes (3 Tg C), and other VOCs (4 Tg C). Mopane savannas and woodlands are predicted to contribute over 75{\%} of all monoterpenes, primarily from light-dependent emission processes. Rain forests cover only 3.5{\%} of the total area but have high annual emission rates (9.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). In the tropical regions with high rainfall, warm temperatures, and high plant productivity throughout the year, the seasonal variation in VOC emissions was small. In subtropical regions, dominated by highly seasonal savannas and grasslands, large variations were predicted, with emissions declining by up to 85{\%} during dry winter periods (June-August) due to low leaf area index after leaf drop.},

The determination of TSP concentration in Calabar Air Basin was carried out on sampling sites covering vehicular source (VS), industrial source (IS), low density residential area (LDRA), high density residential area (HDRA) as well as rural source (RS) to determine levels of concentration for the purpose of source apportionment. TSP was systematically collected directly by the use of a gravimetric high volume air sampler with whatman cellulose filter for a period of two (2) years. The results obtained showed that RS had the lowest TSP concentration of 108.98 µg/m3, while VS had the highest mean concentration of 269.93 µg/m3. There were significant differences at 0.001 confident level between concentrations from RS and LDRA; RS and HDRA; RS and VS. Though TSP concentration in Calabar exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of 40 µg/m, It was lower than those obtained in some Nigerian cities of Lagos (80 - 320 µg/m3 [rain season] and 520 - 800 µg/m3 [dry season), Jos (385 - 911 µg/m3), and in other third world countries of Nairobi (204 - 369 µg/m3) and Shangai (569 µg/m3)(Simoneit et al, 1988; Baumbach et al,1995).},

This paper addresses a gap in this literature through considering critically the role of informal/shadow systems and spaces; the significant inner social workings that constitute what we call the 'invisible aspects' of municipal institutions for learning and decision-making processes. Insights are based on a critical and open reflection of the city of Durban's experience in developing their Municipal Climate Protection Programme (MCPP). We argue that beyond formal institutional requirements or policy, local governments rely considerably on shadow systems and informal spaces of information and knowledge exchange across their operations to introduce and sustain new ideas. This dependence is rarely acknowledged explicitly, however, in research, policy or practice and requires much deeper consideration.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional cloud model with bin microphysics was used to investigate the effects of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations and thermodynamic conditions on convective cloud and precipitation developments. Two different initial cloud droplet spectra were prescribed based on the total CCN concentrations of maritime (300??cm
                        - 3) and continental (1000??cm
                        - 3) air masses, and the model was run on eight thermodynamic conditions obtained from observational soundings. Six-hourly sounding data and 1-hourly precipitation data from two nearby weather stations in Korea were analyzed for the year 2002 to provide some observational support for the model results. For one small Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) (??? 300??J kg
                        - 1) sounding, the maritime and continental differences were incomparably large. The crucial difference was the production of ice phase hydrometeors in the maritime cloud and only water drops in the continental cloud. Ice phase hydrometeors and intrinsically large cloud drops of the maritime cloud eventually lead to significant precipitation. Meanwhile negligible precipitation developed from the continental cloud. For the three other small CAPE soundings, generally weak convective clouds developed but the maritime and continental clouds were of the same phases (both warm or both cold) and their differences were relatively small. Model runs with the four large CAPE (??? 3000??J kg
                        - 1) soundings demonstrated that the depth between the freezing level (FL) and the lifting condensation level (LCL) was crucial to determine whether a cloud becomes a cold cloud or not, which in turn was found to be a crucial factor to enhance cloud invigoration with the additional supply of freezing latent heat. For two large CAPE soundings, FL-LCL was so deep that penetration of FL was prohibitive, and precipitation was only mild in the maritime clouds and negligible in the continental clouds. Two other soundings of similarly large CAPE had small FL-LCL, and both the maritime and continental clouds became cold clouds. Precipitation was strong for both but much more so in the maritime clouds, while the maximum updraft velocity and the cloud top were slightly higher in continental clouds. Although limited to small CAPE cases, more precipitation for smaller FL-LCL for a selected group of precipitation and thermodynamic sounding data from Korea was in support of these model results in its tendency. These results clearly demonstrated that the CCN effects on cloud and precipitation developments critically depended on the given thermodynamic conditions and not just the CAPE but the entire structure of the thermodynamic profiles had to be taken into account. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Indoor air pollution (IAP) from household use of biomass and coal is a leading environmental health risk in many developing nations. Much of the initial research on household energy technology overlooked the complex interactions of technological, behavioral, economic, and infrastructural factors that determine the success of environmental health interventions. Consequently, despite enormous interest in reducing the large and inequitable risks associated with household energy use in international development and global health, there is limited empirical research to form the basis for design and delivery of effective interventions. We used data from four poor provinces in China (Gansu, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, and Shaanxi) to examine the linkages among technology, user knowledge and behavior, and access and infrastructure in exposure to IAP from household energy use. We conclude that broad health risk education is insufficient for successful risk mitigation when exposure behaviors are closely linked to day-to-day activities of households such as cooking and heating, or have other welfare implications, and hence cannot be simply stopped. Rather, there should be emphasis on the economic and infrastructure determinants of access to technology, as well as the details of behaviors that affect exposure. Better understanding of technology-behavior interface would also allow designing technological interventions that account for, and are robust to, behavioral factors or to provide individuals and households with alternative behaviors. Based on the analysis, we present technological and behavioral interventions for these four Chinese provinces.},

Although it is generally accepted that seasonal climate forecasts have potential value, many constraints preclude the optimal use of these forecasts, including the way forecasts are produced, interpreted and applied in a variety of decision-making processes. In South Africa, a variety of agricultural users exists, ranging from the small-scale farmer to larger commercial farming entities. Useful seasonal are those produced and disseminated with the end user in mind. A retroactive test period during the 1990s, evaluates the perceived impact of incorporating seasonal rainfall forecasts into decisions made by commercial crop farmers in the central parts of South Africa. Although a small sample of commercial farmers was interviewed, the results show some benefits to commercial agriculture if seasonal climate forecast information is continuously and effectively applied over the long-term.},

abstract = {Climate change impacts and responses are presently observed in physical and ecological systems. Adaptation to these impacts is increasingly being observed in both physical and ecological systems as well as in human adjustments to resource availability and risk at different spatial and societal scales. We review the nature of adaptation and the implications of different spatial scales for these processes. We outline a set of normative evaluative criteria for judging the success of adaptations at different scales. We argue that elements of effectiveness, efficiency, equity and legitimacy are important in judging success in terms of the sustainability of development pathways into an uncertain future. We further argue that each of these elements of decision-making is implicit within presently formulated scenarios of socio-economic futures of both emission trajectories and adaptation, though with different weighting. The process by which adaptations are to be judged at different scales will involve new and challenging institutional processes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosols are intricately linked to the climate system and to the hydrologic cycle. The net effect of aerosols is to cool the climate system by reflecting sunlight. Depending on their composition, aerosols can also absorb sunlight in the atmosphere, further cooling the surface but warming the atmosphere in the process. These effects of aerosols on the temperature profile, along with the role of aerosols as cloud condensation nuclei, impact the hydrologic cycle, through changes in cloud cover, cloud properties and precipitation. Unravelling these feedbacks is particularly difficult because aerosols take a multitude of shapes and forms, ranging from desert dust to urban pollution, and because aerosol concentrations vary strongly over time and space. To accurately study aerosol distribution and composition therefore requires continuous observations from satellites, networks of ground-based instruments and dedicated field experiments. Increases in aerosol concentration and changes in their composition, driven by industrialization and an expanding population, may adversely affect the Earth's climate and water supply.},

during the last decade. The observed decadal ozone trends are relatively
small at surface sites but are substantially larger at a mountainous

observed changes and how changes in Asian anthropogenic emissions
have contributed to the observed increasing trends. The model with
yearly-dependent regional emissions successfully reproduces the levels,
variability, and interannual variations of ozone at all the surface
sites. It predicts increasing trends at the mountainous site, suggesting
that increasing Asian anthropogenic emissions account for about half
the observed increase. However, the discrepancy between the observation
and model results after 2003 (the time of largest emission increase)
suggests significant underestimation of the actual growth of the
Asian anthropogenic emissions and/or incompleteness in the modeling
of pollution export from continental Asia.},

abstract = {Abstract All of the 0000 UTC soundings from the United States made during the year 1992 that have nonzero convective available potential energy (CAPE) are examined. Soundings are classified as being associated with nonsupercell thunderstorms, supercells without significant tornadoes, and supercells with significant tornadoes. This classification is made by attempting to pair, based on the low-level sounding winds, an upstream sounding with each occurrence of a significant tornado, large hail, and/or 10 or more cloud-to-ground lightning flashes. Severe weather wind parameters (mean shear, 0?6-km shear, storm-relative helicity, and storm-relative anvil-level flow) and CAPE parameters (total CAPE and CAPE in the lowest 3000 m with buoyancy) are shown to discriminate weakly between the environments of the three classified types of storms. Combined parameters (energy?helicity index and vorticity generation parameter) discriminate strongly between the environments. The height of the lifting condensation level also appears to be generally lower for supercells with significant tornadoes than those without. The causes for the very large false alarm rates in the tornadic/nontornadic supercell forecast, even with the best discriminators, are discussed.},

abstract = {This study has used a numerical model (RAMS) at 1??km horizontal grid intervals over the Sydney Basin to assess the impact of land cover change on storms. Multiple storms using the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data were simulated with pre-European settlement land cover then re-simulated with land cover representing Sydney's current land use pattern. While all simulated storms did not respond to the change in land cover consistently, storms of similar types responded in comparable ways. All simulated synoptically forced storms (e.g. those triggered by cold fronts) were unresponsive to a changed land surface, while local convective storms were highly sensitive to the triggering mechanism associated with land surface influences. Storms travelling over the smoother agricultural land in the south-west of the Sydney Basin experienced an increase in velocity, and in a special case, the dense urban surface of Sydney's city core appears to trigger an intense convective storm. It is shown that the dynamical setting predominantly triggers storm outbreaks. This is seen most clearly in the isolated convective storm category where the sea breeze front often dictates the location of storm cell initiation. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Ultrafine aerosol particles smaller than 50 nanometers (UAP{\textless}50) can be abundant in the troposphere but are conventionally considered too small to affect cloud formation. Observational evidence and numerical simulations of deep convective clouds (DCCs) over the Amazon show that DCCs forming in a low-aerosol environment can develop very large vapor supersaturation because fast droplet coalescence reduces integrated droplet surface area and subsequent condensation. UAP{\textless}50from pollution plumes that are ingested into such clouds can be activated to form additional cloud droplets on which excess supersaturation condenses and forms additional cloud water and latent heating, thus intensifying convective strength. This mechanism suggests a strong anthropogenic invigoration of DCCs in previously pristine regions of the world.},

Aboard this aircraft was a Particle Concentrator-Brigham Young University Organic Sampling System (PC-BOSS), which was used to determine semivolatile particulate material with a diffusion denuder sampler. Denuded quartz filters and sorbent beds in series were used to measure nonvolatile and semivolatile materials, respectively. Results obtained with the PC-BOSS are compared to those obtained with conventional quartz-quartz and Teflon-quartz filter pack samplers. Various 10-120 min integrated samples were collected during flights through the h e troposphere, in the atmospheric boundary layer, and in plumes from savanna fires. Significant fine particulate semivolatile organic compounds (SVOC) were found in all samples. The SVOC was not collected by conventional filter pack samplers and therefore would not have been determined in previous studies that used only filter pack samplers. The SVOC averaged 24{\%} of the fine particulate mass in emissions from the fires and 36{\%} of the fine particulate mass in boundary layer samples heavily impacted by aged emissions from savanna fires. Concentrations of fine particulate material in the atmospheric mixed layer heavily impacted by aged savanna frre emissions averaged 130 micrograms per cubic meter.

abstract = {Global efforts are underway to develop and promote improved cookstoves which may reduce the negative health and environmental effects of burning solid fuels on health and the environment. Behavioral studies have considered cookstove user practices, needs and preferences in the design and implementation of cookstove projects; however, these studies have not examined the implications of the traditional stove use and design across multiple resource-poor settings in the implementation and promotion of improved cookstove projects that utilize a single, standardized stove design. We conducted in-depth interviews and direct observations of meal preparation and traditional, open-fire stove use of 137 women aged 20-49 years in Kenya, Peru and Nepal prior in the four-month period preceding installation of an improved cookstove as part of a field intervention trial. Despite general similarities in cooking practices across sites, we identified locally distinct practices and norms regarding traditional stove use and desired stove improvements. Traditional stoves are designed to accommodate specific cooking styles, types of fuel, and available resources for maintenance and renovation. The tailored stoves allow users to cook and repair their stoves easily. Women in each setting expressed their desire for a new stove, but they articulated distinct specific alterations that would meet their needs and preferences. Improved cookstove designs need to consider the diversity of values and needs held by potential users, presenting a significant challenge in identifying a "one size fits all" improved cookstove design. Our data show that a single stove design for use with locally available biomass fuels will not meet the cooking demands and resources available across the three sites. Moreover, locally produced or adapted improved cookstoves may be needed to meet the cooking needs of diverse populations while addressing health and environmental concerns of traditional stoves.},

abstract = {We develop an improved retrieval of sulfur dioxide (SO2) vertical
columns from two satellite instruments (SCIAMACHY and OMI) that measure
ultraviolet solar backscatter. For each SCIAMACHY and OMI observation,
a local air mass factor (AMF) algorithm converts line-of-sight slant
columns to vertical columns using altitude-dependent scattering weights
computed with a radiative transfer model (LIDORT), weighted by relative
vertical SO2 profile (shape factor) determined locally with a global
atmospheric chemistry model (GEOS-Chem). The scattering weights account
for viewing geometry, surface albedo, cloud scattering, absorption
by ozone, and scattering and absorption by aerosols. Absorption of
radiation by mineral dust can reduce seasonal mean instrument sensitivity
by 50{\%}. Mean SO2 shape factors simulated with GEOS-Chem and used
in the AMF calculation are highly consistent with airborne in situ
measurements (INTEX-A and INTEX-B); differences would affect the
retrieved SO2 columns by 10{\%}. The retrieved vertical columns are
validated with coincident airborne in situ measurements (INTEX-A,
INTEX-B, and a campaign over east China). The annual mean AMF errors
are estimated to be 35{\%} in polluted regions (e.g., East Asia and
the eastern United States) and less than 10{\%} over clear ocean regions.
The overall SO2 error assessment is 45{\%} for yearly averages over
polluted regions. Seasonal mean SO2 columns retrieved from SCIAMACHY
and OMI for 2006 are significantly spatially correlated with those
from GEOS-Chem, in particular over the United States (r = 0.85 for
SCIAMACHY and 0.82 for OMI). A sensitivity study confirms the sensitivity
of SCIAMACHY and OMI to anthropogenic SO2 emissions.},

A boundary layer diffusion package based on the Troen and Mahrt nonlocal diffusion concept has been tested for possible operational implementation. The results from this approach are compared with those from the local diffusion approach, which is the current operational scheme, and verified against FIFE observations during 9–10 August 1987. The comparisons between local and nonlocal approaches are extended to the forecast for a heavy rain case of 15–17 May 1995. The sensitivity of both the boundary layer development and the precipitation forecast to the tuning parameters in the nonlocal diffusion scheme is also investigated. Special attention is given to the interaction of boundary layer processes with precipitation physics. Some results of parallel runs during August 1995 are also presented.},

@article{Garcia-Ortega2007,
abstract = {During the afternoon of August 16th 2003 a severe hail event occurred in the town of Alca??iz in the Ebro Valley (Spain). This storm brought with it intense rain and hail precipitation that caused severe floods, damaged cars and street furniture. A diagnosis, using data from ECMWF, showed the presence of a mesolow at surface level centered over the Northeast of Spain, carrying winds from the Mediterranean Sea towards the Central Ebro Valley. At medium and high levels, a trough, whose axis extended over the Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, moved eastwards preceded at 500??hPa by a thermal trough that caused increasing instability before the arrival of the geopotential trough. A numerical study of this event has been carried out using the MM5 model with a double aim. On the one hand, it attempts to check whether or not the simulation reproduces the storm in Alca??iz. On the other hand, it carries out a sensitivity experiment in order to evaluate the contribution of two specific factors: topography and solar radiation. Compared with radar data, the control simulation reproduces the region affected by the storm reasonably well. The suppression of topography and/or solar radiation substantially modifies the surface mesolow and the spatial distribution of the precipitation. Neither of these factors, considered independently, reproduces the precipitation caused by the storm in Alca??iz. However, the results illustrate the importance of the synergic effect of these two factors on the spatial localization of the storm and on the intensity of the precipitation registered. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The expansion of evidence-based practice across sectors has lead to an increasing variety of review types. However, the diversity of terminology used means that the full potential of these review types may be lost amongst a confusion of indistinct and misapplied terms. The objective of this study is to provide descriptive insight into the most common types of reviews, with illustrative examples from health and health information domains. METHODS: Following scoping searches, an examination was made of the vocabulary associated with the literature of review and synthesis (literary warrant). A simple analytical framework -- Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis (SALSA) -- was used to examine the main review types. RESULTS: Fourteen review types and associated methodologies were analysed against the SALSA framework, illustrating the inputs and processes of each review type. A description of the key characteristics is given, together with perceived strengths and weaknesses. A limited number of review types are currently utilized within the health information domain. CONCLUSIONS: Few review types possess prescribed and explicit methodologies and many fall short of being mutually exclusive. Notwithstanding such limitations, this typology provides a valuable reference point for those commissioning, conducting, supporting or interpreting reviews, both within health information and the wider health care domain.},

abstract = {Air pollution in residential areas is a problem in South Africa. The connection of low income households to the national electricity grid is perceived as one of the strategic measures taken by the government to solve the issue. In Leandra/Lebohang, a low income residential area on the Highveld, 1034 households were provided with electricity in 2001. Ambient PM 10 and SO 2 concentrations monitored in Leandra show that the electrification resulted in a significant reduction in PM 10 concentrations particularly during the morning and evening peaks. There was also somewhat of a reduction in SO 2 concentrations, although a non-local, probably industrial source, also contributes to SO 2 levels in Leandra. PM 10 and SO 2 concentrations increased steadily again after the electrification, as the township expanded and the domestic use of coal increased. Annual PM 10 concentrations were above the national annual limit (50 $\mu$g/m 3 ) for all years during the 1999-2005 monitoring period except during 2001 and 2002. The number of exceedances of the PM 10 daily limit was as high as 141 in 2000 and dropped to 0 in 2001. The SO 2 annual national limit (19 ppb) was never exceeded during the 1999- 2008 monitoring period. However, SO 2 daily average national standard (48 ppb) was exceeded several times at Leandra with up to twelve exceedences measured in 2000. Effectively, electricity use reduces domestic emissions in low income residential areas by replacing coal and other dirtier fuels used for cooking and space heating and improve ambient air quality.},

                        2.5 mass at four roof-top fixed sites, also used for particle speciation; (ii) continuous PM
                        10 and PM
                        2.5 at one fixed site; and (iii) 96-hour integrated concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO
                        2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO
                        2) at 30 fixed sites. We also conducted seven consecutive days of mobile monitoring of PM
                        10 and PM
                        2.5 mass and submicron particle count. PM
                        10 ranged from 57.9 to 93.6????g/m
                        3 at the four sites, with a weighted average of 71.8????g/m
                        3 and PM
                        2.5 from 22.3 to 40.2????g/m
                        3, with an average of 27.4????g/m
                        3. PM
                        2.5/PM
                        10 ratio at the four fixed sites ranged from 0.33 to 0.43. Elemental carbon (EC) was 10-11{\%} of PM
                        2.5 mass at all four measurement sites; organic matter (OM) formed slightly less than 50{\%} of PM
                        2.5 mass. Cl, K, and S had the largest elemental contributions to PM
                        2.5 mass, and Cl, Si, Ca, Fe, and Al to coarse particles. SO
                        2 and NO
                        2 concentrations were almost universally lower than the US-EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), with virtually no variation across sites. There is evidence for the contributions from biomass and traffic sources, and from geological and marine non-combustion sources to particle pollution. The implications of the results for future urban air pollution monitoring and measurement in developing countries are discussed. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A one-dimensional steady-state cloud model was combined with a time-dependent hail growth model to predict the maximum hailstone size on the ground. Model runs were based on 160 proximity soundings recorded within the Alberta Hail Project area for three summers between 1983 and 1985. The forecast hail sizes were verified against reports of maximum hail size gathered from a high-density observation network within the project area. The probability of detection (POD), the false-alarm ratio (FAR), and the Heidke skill score (HSS) were computed for the hail model forecasts and were compared with the skill scores for a nomogram method developed to forecast hail size in Alberta. The hail model was skillful in forecasting hail (POD 5 0.85, FAR 5 0.26, HSS 5 0.64). On days with hail larger than 2 cm in diameter, the hail model performed slightly better (POD 5 0.90, FAR 5 0.40, HSS 5 0.67). Analysis of the skill scores and hail-size forecasts suggests that employing a coupled cloud and hail model noticeably improves the overall skill and accuracy of hail forecasts as compared with those determined using the nomogram.},

@article{Brandes1999,
abstract = {Radar reflectivity–based rainfall estimates from collocated radars are examined. The usual large storm-to- storm variations in radar bias and high correlation between radar estimates and rain gauge observations are found. For three storms in Colorado, the radar bias factor (the ratio between gauge observations and radar estimates) with the National Center for Atmospheric Research's S-band, dual-polarization radar (S-Pol) varied from 0.78 (an overestimate with radar) to 1.88. The correlation coefficient between gauge and radar amounts varied from 0.78 to 0.90. For a collocatedWeather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D), the bias factor varied from 0.56 to 1.49, and the correlation between gauge and radar amounts ranged from 0.77 to 0.87. In Kansas, bias factors varied from 0.86 to 1.41 for S-Pol (10 storms) and 0.82 to 1.71 for a paired WSR-88D (9 storms). The spread in correlation coefficients was 0.82–0.95 for S-Pol and 0.87–0.95 for the WSR-88D. Correspondence between the radar-derived rainfall estimates for the paired radars was very high; correlation coefficients were 0.88 to 0.98. Moreover, the ratio between rainfall estimates (S-Pol/paired WSR-88D) varied only from 0.72 to 0.85 in Colorado and 0.82 to 1.05 in Kansas. The total variation in radar-to-radar rainfall estimates, roughly a factor of 1.2, is attributed primarily to nonmeteorological factors relating to radar hardware and processing. The radar-to-radar variation is small compared to the spread in storm-to-storm biases, which varied from a low of 1.64 with the S-Pol radar in Kansas to a high of 2.66 with the WSR-88D in Colorado. For this investigation, the storm-to-storm bias must have a large meteorological component—probably due to temporal and spatial changes in drop size distributions and consequently variations in the relationship between radar reflectivity and rainfall rate.},

Polarimetric data from the S-band Dual-Polarization Doppler Radar (S-Pol) during the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)/Brazil campaign are analyzed; specifically, the gamma parameters are retrieved for samples of convective and trailing stratiform rain during the 15 February 1999 squall-line event. Histograms of Nw and Do are retrieved from radar for each rain type and compared with related statistics reported in the literature. The functional behavior of Nw and Do versus rain rate retrieved from radar is compared against samples of 2D-video and RD-69 disdrometer data obtained during the campaign.

This article outlines the development of a student evaluation instrument designed to measure the teaching performance of academic organisational units. The theory of teaching and learning that underlies the Course Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) is described. The instrument's statistical qualities and its ability to discriminate intelligibly between different courses are discussed in the context of results from national trials in Australian higher education. The principal conclusion reached is that the CEQ offers a reliable, verifiable and useful means of determining the perceived teaching quality of academic units in systems of higher education that are based on British models. Several technical and political issues remain unresolved in its application as a PI.},

Expanding on the earlier analysis, it is shown that three modified forecast parameters have more value in distinguishing between environments that favor significant tornadoes and those that favor large hail but no significant tornadoes, in the climatological data. These parameters are storm-relative helicity in the 0–1-km layer adjacent to the ground, energy–helicity index computed from this measure of helicity, and the convective available potential energy that accrues from the surface to 3 km above ground level. In addition, this note provides caveats regarding the interpretation of the climatological findings.},

abstract = {The Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) mission will provide a calibration laboratory in orbit for the purpose of accurately measuring and attributing climate change. CLARREO measurements establish new climate change benchmarks with high absolute radiometric accuracy and high statistical confidence across a wide range of essential climate variables. CLARREO's inherently high absolute accuracy will be verified and traceable on orbit to Syst{\`{e}}me Internationale (SI) units. The benchmarks established by CLARREO will be critical for assessing changes in the Earth system and climate model predictive capabilities for decades into the future as society works to meet the challenge of optimizing strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change. The CLARREO benchmarks are derived from measurements of the Earth's thermal infrared spectrum (5–50 $\mu$m), the spectrum of solar radiation reflected by the Earth and its atmosphere (320–2300 nm), and radio occultation refractivity from which accurate temperature profiles are derived. The mission has the ability to provide new spectral fingerprints of climate change, as well as to provide the first orbiting radiometer with accuracy sufficient to serve as the reference transfer standard for other space sensors, in essence serving as a “NIST [National Institute of Standards and Technology] in orbit.” CLARREO will greatly improve the accuracy and relevance of a wide range of space-borne instruments for decadal climate change. Finally, CLARREO has developed new metrics and methods for determining the accuracy requirements of climate observations for a wide range of climate variables and uncertainty sources. These methods should be useful for improving our understanding of observing requirements for most climate change observations.},

abstract = {The feasibility of hurricane modification was investigated for hurricane$\backslash$nKatrina using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). The$\backslash$npossible impact of seeding of clouds with submicron cloud condensation$\backslash$nnuclei (CCN) on hurricane structure and intensity as measured by nearly$\backslash$nhalving of the area covered by hurricane force winds was simulated by$\backslash$n`turning-off' warm rain formation in the clouds at Katrina's periphery$\backslash$n(where wind speeds were less than 22 m s(-1)). This simplification of$\backslash$nthe simulation of aerosol effects is aimed at evaluating the largest$\backslash$npossible response. This resulted in the weakening of the hurricane$\backslash$nurface winds compared to the `non-seeded' simulated storm during the$\backslash$nfirst 24 h within the entire tropical cyclone (TC) area compared to a$\backslash$ncontrol simulation without warm rain suppression. Later, the$\backslash$nseeding-induced evaporative cooling at the TC periphery led to a$\backslash$nshrinking of the eye and hence to some increase in the wind within the$\backslash$nsmall central area of the TC. Yet, the overall strength of the$\backslash$nhurricane, as defined by the area covered by hurricane force winds,$\backslash$ndecreased in response to the suppressed warm rain at the periphery, as$\backslash$nmeasured by a 25{\%} reduction in the radius of hurricane force winds. In$\backslash$na simulation with warm rain suppression throughout the hurricane, the$\backslash$nradius of the hurricane force winds was reduced by more than 42{\%}, and$\backslash$nalthough the diameter of the eye shrunk even further the maximum winds$\backslash$nweakened. This shows that the main mechanism by which suppressing warm$\backslash$nrain weakens the TC is the low level evaporative cooling of the$\backslash$nun-precipitated cloud drops and the added cooling due to melting of$\backslash$nprecipitation that falls from above.},

In this paper we examine how well three higher-order closure models, E l, E l,and LRR l, which have been especially modified for PBL applications, performin predicting the behaviour of the cross-isobaric angle $\alpha$0, the geostrophic drag coefficient Cg, and the integral of the dissipation rate over the boundary layer, as a function of the surface Rossby number Ro. For comparison we also examine the performance of three first-order closure mixing-length models, two proposed by A. K. Blackadar and one by H. H. Lettau, and the performance of the standard model for second-order closure and a modification of it designed to reduce the overprediction of turbulence in the upper part of the boundary layer},

abstract = {Quantifying the aerosol/cloud-mediated radiative effect at a global scale requires simultaneous satellite retrievals of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations and cloud base updraft velocities (Wb). Hitherto, the inability to do so has been a major cause of high uncertainty regarding anthropogenic aerosol/cloud-mediated radiative forcing. This can be addressed by the emerging capability of estimating CCN and Wb of boundary layer convective clouds from an operational polar orbiting weather satellite. Our methodology uses such clouds as an effective analog for CCN chambers. The cloud base supersaturation (S) is determined by Wb and the satellite-retrieved cloud base drop concentrations (Ndb), which is the same as CCN(S). Validation against ground-based CCN instruments at Oklahoma, at Manaus, and onboard a ship in the northeast Pacific showed a retrieval accuracy of ±25{\%} to ±30{\%} for individual satellite overpasses. The methodology is presently limited to boundary layer not raining convective clouds of at least 1 km depth that are not obscured by upper layer clouds, including semitransparent cirrus. The limitation for small solar backscattering angles of {\textless}25° restricts the satellite coverage to ∼25{\%} of the world area in a single day.},

abstract = {Regulatory models are useful tools for air quality management. However, application of models without proper evaluation may lead to erroneous conclusions and thus systematic model evaluation studies are essential prior to model application. Often, models are evaluated for a specific source and climatic condition and then find application to another source and climatic condition without this realization. In this context, two well known regulatory models namely; AERMOD (07026) and ADMS-Urban (2.2) are applied throughout the world in various countries without rigorous evaluation procedures. An attempt is made here to undertake performance evaluation of these models for a tropical city such as Delhi in India which is a well known megacity of the world. The models have been applied to estimate ambient particulate matter concentrations for the years 2000 and 2004 over seven sites in Delhi and model evaluation and inter-comparison is performed. Concentrations have been estimated for winter season in both years as the low temperature and low speed wind conditions in this season make it most significant from air pollution point of view. It has been found that though both the models have a tendency towards under-prediction, estimated values by both models agree with the observed concentrations within factor of two. However ADMS-Urban results show better trend correlation with observed values while bias between observed and estimated values is lower for AERMOD Results. The models include all the urban sources (ie. elevated point sources, vehicular traffic, domestic and other sources) in the city. The model validation is discussed in the light of emission inventory, requisite meteorological inputs and statistical performance measures. Performance evaluation of the above models is examined based on boundary layer parameterisations used in these models. Intercomparison of the model performances is envisaged to be useful for application to air quality management and further development of these models. {\textcopyright} Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.},

abstract = {In rural towns of southern Australia, smoke from biomass burning such as prescribed burning of forests, wildfires and stubble burning is often claimed to be the major source of air pollution. To investigate the validity of this claim, ambient measurements of PM
                        2.5 and ozone were made in two rural locations in southern Australia between 2006 and 2008. In order to distinguish PM
                        2.5 associated with smoke from other sources of particulate pollution, PM
                        2.5 samples were analysed for specific smoke tracers, levoglucosan, non sea-salt potassium (nssK
                        +) and oxalate. Monitoring was also undertaken in four homes to determine the extent to which ambient pollutants from prescribed burning penetrate indoors into houses. Monitoring clearly showed that, on occasions, air quality in rural areas is significantly affected by smoke from biomass combustion with PM
                        2.5 showing the greatest impact. Concentrations of PM
                        2.5 increased significantly above background levels at both sites during periods of wildfire and prescribed fire leading to exceedences of the 24-h PM
                        2.5 Air National Environment Protection Measure (NEPM) Advisory standard. The 1-h and 4-h ozone NEPM standards were exceeded only during protracted forest wildfires. The impact of prescribed burning on the indoor air quality of residences depended on the duration of the smoke event and the ventilation rate of the houses. During short-duration events indoor air quality was determined by household activities.

abstract = {AbstractLarge-scale environmental variables known to be linked to the formation of tropical cyclones, have previously been used to develop empirical indices as proxies for assessing cyclone frequency from large-scale analyses or model simulations. Here we examine the ability of two recent indices, the Genesis Potential and the Genesis Potential Index to reproduce observed North Atlantic cyclone annual frequency variations and trends. These skillfully estimate the mean seasonal variation of observed cyclones, but they struggle with reproducing interannual frequency variability and change. Examination of the independent contributions by the four terms that make up the indices finds that potential intensity and shear have significant skill, while moisture and vorticity either do not contribute or degrade the indices capacity to reproduce observed interannual variability. We also find that for assessing basin wide cyclone frequency, averaging indices over the whole basin is less skillful than its application ...},

abstract = {The assessment of the wind blown dust emission for Europe and selected regions of North Africa and Southwest Asia was carried out using a mesoscale model. The mesoscale model was parameterized based on the current literature review. The model provides data on PM10 emission from several dust reservoirs (anthropogenic, agriculture, semi- and natural) with spatial resolution of 10 × 10 km and temporal resolution of 1 h. The spatial variability of PM10 emission depends on soil texture, land cover/land use as well as meteorological conditions. Lands covered with water or permanently wet were excluded from the model. The land covered with vegetation is treated as dust reservoir whose dust emission capacity depends on the type of vegetation and cover. The dust reservoirs are divided into reservoirs with stable and unstable surface. The changes of emission in time depend on meteorological parameters. The wind blown dust emission should be treated as a non-continuous spatio-temporal process. The emissions are estimated with high uncertainty. The estimated PM10 yearly total load emitted by wind from the European territory is highly differentiated in space and time and is equal to 0.74 Tg. The total load of PM10 emitted by wind from North African and Southwest Asian land surface located in the vicinity of European boundaries is assessed as nearly 50{\%} (0.43 Tg) of the total load estimated for the whole Europe. The average yearly PM10 emission factor for Europe was estimated at 0.139 Mg km-2. The PM10 emission from agricultural areas is estimated at 52{\%} of the total wind blown emission from the domain of the European Union project "Improving and applying methods for the calculation of natural and biogenic emissions and assessment of impacts to the air quality" - NatAir. PM10 emission factor for natural areas of Europe is estimated at 0.021 Mg km-2. Appropriate factors for agricultural areas and anthropogenic areas are 0.157 Mg km-2 and 0.118 Mg km-2, respectively. The latter two factors are probably underestimated due to omitting in the model of other dust emission mechanisms than aeolian erosion. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The direct radiative forcing (DRF) of sulfate and black carbon (BC) aerosols is investigated using a new multispectral radiation code within the R30 Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory general circulation model (GCM). Two independent sulfate climatologies from chemical transport models are applied to the GCM; each climatology has a different atmospheric burden, vertical profile, and seasonal cycle. The DRF is calculated to be approximately −0.6 and −0.8 W m−2 for the different sulfate climatologies. Additional sensitivity studies show that the vertical profile of the sulfate aerosol is important in determining the DRF; sulfate residing near the surface gives the strongest DRF due to the effects of relative humidity. Calculations of the DRF due to BC reveal that the DRF remains uncertain to approximately a factor of 3 due to uncertainties in the total atmospheric burden, the vertical profile of the BC, and the assumed size distribution. Because of the uncertainties in the total global mass of BC, the normalized DRF (the DRF per unit column mass of aerosol in watts per milligram (W mg−1)) due to BC is estimated; the range is +1.1 to + 1.9 W mg−1 due to uncertainties in the vertical profile. These values correspond to a DRF of approximately +0.4 W m−2 with a factor of 3 uncertainty when the uncertainty in the total global mass of BC is included. In contrast to sulfate aerosol, the contribution to the global DRF from cloudy regions is very significant, being estimated as approximately 60{\%}. The vertical profile of the BC is, once again, important in determining the DRF, but the sensitivity is reversed from that of sulfate; BC near the surface gives the weakest DRF due to the shielding effects of overlying clouds. Although the uncertainty in the estimates of the DRF due to BC remains high, these results indicate that the DRF due to absorption by BC aerosol may contribute a significant positive radiative forcing and may consequently be important in determining climatic changes in the Earth-atmosphere system.},

Whether or not a site is suitable will be determined by establishing that it can meet a set of performance requirements for safe and effective geologic storage. To date, no such performance requirements have been developed. Establishing effective requirements must start with an evaluation of how much CO2 might be stored and for how long the CO2 must remain underground to meet goals for controlling atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Answers to these questions provide a context for setting performance requirements for geologic storage projects.},

abstract = {Aerosol properties, including optical thickness and size parameters, are retrieved operationally from the MODIS sensor onboard the Terra satellite launched on 18 December 1999. The predominant aerosol type over the Southern African region is smoke, which is generated from biomass burning on land and transported over the southern Atlantic Ocean. The SAFARI-2000 period experienced smoke aerosol emissions from the regular biomass burning activities as well as from the prescribed burns administered on the auspices of the experiment. The MODIS Aerosol Science Team (MAST) formulates and implements strategies for the retrieval of aerosol products from MODIS, as well as for validating and analyzing them in order to estimate aerosol effects in the radiative forcing of climate as accurately as possible. These activities are carried out not only from a global perspective, but also with a focus on specific regions identified as having interesting characteristics, such as the biomass burning phenomenon in southern Africa and the associated smoke aerosol, particulate, and trace gas emissions. Indeed, the SAFARI-2000 aerosol measurements from the ground and from aircraft, along with MODIS, provide excellent data sources for a more intensive validation and a closer study of the aerosol characteristics over Southern Africa. The SAFARI-2000 ground-based measurements of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) from both the automatic Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and handheld Sun photometers have been used to validate MODIS retrievals, based on a sophisticated spatio-temporal technique. The average global monthly distribution of aerosol from MODIS has been combined with other data to calculate the southern African aerosol daily averaged (24 hr) radiative forcing over the ocean for September 2000. It is estimated that on the average, for cloud free conditions over an area of 9 million square kin, this predominantly smoke aerosol exerts a forcing of -30 W/square m C lose to the terrestrial surface and -10 W/square m at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). While cooling the surface and Earth system, the difference of 20 W/square m is energy that heats the atmosphere.},

abstract = {Past research indicates that personal flood experience is an important factor in motivating mitigation behavior. It is not fully clear, however, why such experience is so important. This study tested the hypothesis that people without flooding experience underestimate the negative affect evoked by such an event. People who were affected by a severe recent flood disaster were compared with people who were not affected, but who also lived in flood-prone areas. Face-to-face interviews with open and closed questions were conducted (n= 201). Results suggest that people without flood experience envisaged the consequences of a flood differently from people who had actually experienced severe losses due to a flood. People who were not affected strongly underestimated the negative affect associated with a flood. Based on the results, it can be concluded that risk communication must not focus solely on technical aspects; in order to trigger motivation for mitigation behavior, successful communication must also help people to envisage the negative emotional consequences of natural disasters.},

abstract = {This paper explores the many aspects of precipitation measurement that are relevant to providing an accurate global assessment of this important environmental parameter. Methods discussed include ground data, satellite estimates and numerical models. First, the methods for measuring, estimating, and modeling precipitation are discussed. Then, the most relevant datasets gathering precipitation information from those three sources are presented. The third part of the paper illustrates a number of the many applications of those measurements and databases, namely hydropower, data assimilation and validation of Regional Climate Models (RCM). The aim of the paper is to organize the many links and feedbacks between precipitation measurement, estimation and modeling, indicating the uncertainties and limitations of each technique in order to identify areas requiring further attention, and to show the limits within which datasets can be used. Special emphasis is put on the central role of the upcoming Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission in precipitation science. {\textcopyright}2011.},

abstract = {Toward the end of the Cirrus Regional Study of Tropical Anvils and Cirrus Layer–Florida Area Cirrus Experiment (CRYSTAL–FACE) field campaign held during July 2002, high concentrations of Saharan dust, which can serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), giant CCN (GCCN), and ice-forming nuclei (IFN) were observed over the peninsula of Florida. To investigate the impacts of enhanced aerosol concentrations on the characteristics of convective storms and their subsequent anvil development, sensitivity tests are conducted using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) model, in which the initialization profiles of CCN, GCCN, and IFN concentrations are varied. These variations are found to have significant effects on the storm dynamics and microphysical processes, as well as on the surface precipitation. Updrafts are consistently stronger as the aerosol concentrations are increased. The anvils cover a smaller area but are better organized and have larger condensate mixing ratio maxima in the cases with greater aerosol concentrations. Cloud water mass tends to increase with increasing aerosol concentrations, with enhanced GCCN concentrations having the most significant influence. Increasing either the GCCN or IFN concentrations produces the most rainfall at the surface whereas enhanced CCN concentrations reduce surface rainfall. Higher IFN concentrations produce ice at warmer temperatures and deeper anvils, but simultaneously increasing the concentrations of CCN and GCCN leads to more supercooled liquid water available for freezing and greater ice mixing ratios. Graupel mixing ratios decrease and hail mixing ratios increase with increasing aerosol concentrations. Higher concentrations of GCCN and IFN result in greater accumulated surface precipitation initially. By the end of the simulation period, however, the accumulated precipitation is the greatest for the case in which the aerosol concentrations are lowest. Such changes in the dynamical and microphysical characteristics of convective storms as a result of the variations in aerosol concentrations have potential climate consequences, both through cloud radiative effects and the hydrological cycle. The impacts of varying CCN, GCCN, and IFN concentrations on the anvils will be discussed more fully in Part II.},

abstract = {A new type of ultra-high resolution atmospheric global circulation model is developed. The new model is designed to perform "cloud resolving simulations" by directly calculating deep convection and meso-scale circulations, which play key roles not only in the tropical circulations but in the global circulations of the atmosphere. Since cores of deep convection have a few km in horizontal size, they have not directly been resolved by existing atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). In order to drastically enhance horizontal resolution, a new framework of a global atmospheric model is required; we adopted nonhydrostatic governing equations and icosahedral grids to the new model, and call it Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM). In this article, we review governing equations and numerical techniques employed, and present the results from the unique 3.5-km mesh global experiments-with O(109) computational nodes-using realistic topography and land/ocean surface thermal forcing. The results show realistic behaviors of multi-scale convective systems in the tropics, which have not been captured by AGCMs. We also argue future perspective of the roles of the new model in the next generation atmospheric sciences. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The analysis reported an extremely active storm, evolving through distinct phases, which stood out from a multicell structure to finally become a supercell. The onset of newer regions of convective development interacting with the main cell made the charge structure to be rather complex during some stages of this long-lived hailstorm. Evidence suggests the presence of regions with the charge layer being inverted from that of normal, non-severe convective storms, producing predominantly positive cloud-to-ground lightning. The analysis also suggests that strong cloud signals were misclassified as low peak current single-stroke negative cloud-to-ground flashes, masking the predominant positive nature of the storm.},

Oscillation (ENSO) forced pattern in the extratropical Southern Hemisphere

and extratropical RWS in the SH develops before the ENSO peak season
and abruptly weakens thereafter. Further analysis shows that anomalous
divergence/convergence and corresponding irrotational wind anomalies
are sensitive to local seasonality. Numerical experiments in which
the tropical Pacific is prescribed with perfectly periodic ENSO while
all other oceans are simulated as a slab mixed layer model coupled
to AGCM also show similar features. Additional numerical experiments
in which ENSO forcing is shifted by 6 months (i.e., the ENSO peak
in the southern winter season) indicate that the Northern Hemisphere
atmosphere rather than the SH atmosphere precedes ENSO. This result
supports the hypothesis that the ENSO forced pattern in the extratropics
is strongly limited by local seasonality, rather than by the temporal
phase of tropical remote forcing.},

abstract = {Recent work has shown that current bio-energy policy directives may
have harmful, indirect consequences, affecting both food security
and the global climate system. An additional unintended but direct
effect of large-scale biofuel production is the impact on local and
regional climate resulting from changes in the energy and moisture
balance of the surface upon conversion to biofuel crops. Using the
latest version of the WRF modeling system we conducted twenty-four,
midsummer, continental-wide, sensitivity experiments by imposing
realistic biophysical parameter limits appropriate for bio-energy
crops in the Corn Belt of the United States. In the absence of strain/crop-specific
parameterizations, a primary goal of this work was to isolate the
maximum regional climate impact, for a trio of individual July months,
due to land-use change resulting from bio-energy crops and to identify
the relative importance of each biophysical parameter in terms of
its individual effect. Maximum, local changes in 2 m temperature
of the order of 1degC occur for the full breadth of albedo (ALB),
minimum canopy resistance (RCMIN), and rooting depth (ROOT) specifications,
while the regionally (105degW and 35degN) and monthly averaged response
of 2 m temperature was most pronounced for the ALB and RCMIN experiments,
exceeding 0.2degC. The full range of albedo variability associated
with biofuel crops may be sufficient to drive regional changes in
summertime rainfall. Individual parameter effects on 2 m temperature
are additive, highlight the cooling contribution of higher leaf area
index (LAI) and ROOT for perennial grasses (e.g., Miscanthus) versus
annual crops (e.g., maize), and underscore the necessity of improving
location- and vegetation-specific representation of RCMIN and ALB.},

Air pollution in cities is a serious environmental problem – especially in the developing countries. The air pollution path of the urban atmosphere consists of emission and transmission of air pollutants resulting in the ambient air pollution. Each part of the path is influenced by different factors. Emissions from motor traffic are a very important source group throughout the world. During transmission, air pollutants are dispersed, diluted and subjected to photochemical reactions. Ambient air pollution shows temporal and spatial variability. As an example of the temporal variability of urban air pollutants caused by motor traffic, typical average annual, weekly and diurnal cycles of NO, NO2, O3 and Ox are presented for an official urban air-quality station in Stuttgart, southern Germany. They are supplemented by weekly and diurnal cycles of selected percentile values of NO, NO2, and O3. Time series of these air pollutants give information on their trends. Results are discussed with regard to air pollution conditions in other cities. Possibilities for the assessment of air pollution in cities are shown. In addition, a qualitative overview of the air quality of the world's megacities is given.},

abstract = {Unusually heavy monsoon rains in Northern Pakistan have caused disproportionate levels of extreme flooding and unprecedented flood losses across the entire Indus River basin. Extensive land use changes and environmental degradation in the uplands and lowlands of the river basin together with the construction of a “built environment” out of balance with the functioning, capacities, scale and limits of the local ecosystems have exposed millions of people to an increased risk of extreme {\#}ooding. The catastrophic nature of the August {\#}ooding provides a unique opportunity to fundamentally change Pakistan's current socio-economic development path by incorporating disaster risk reduction and climate change measures into the post-disaster recovery process to rebuild a safer, more resilient nation. In January 2005 one hundred and sixty-eight nations adopted the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA)2005-2015 to bring about a “substantial reduction in disaster losses” by 2015. Despite this global initiative a series of major disasters, including the recent flooding in Pakistan, all indicate that we are not on track to achieve the substantial reduction of disaster losses. The following fieldnote considers what can be done to accelerate progress towards implementation of the Hyogo Framework, drawing on insights and lessons learnt from the August flooding to understand how Pakistan and neighbouring countries can prevent a repeat of such catastrophic disasters in future years.},

In this study, Carvel radar (53.34°N, 114.09°W) data from July 2000 were processed using McGill's RAPID software. Specifically, we compared observations of severe convection, as identified by selected radar‐based reflectivity parameters, with surface severe weather reports and atmospheric sounding data. July 2000 was characterized by frequent severe thunderstorm activity over central Alberta; there were seven days with golfball‐sized hail, and two days with confirmed tornadoes. The VIL, upper level VIL (UVIL), and the maximum reflectivity at 7 km (Z7) were employed to quantify the strength and frequency of storms within a 120‐km radial distance of Carvel. For each day, the intensity of the convection was quantified by counting the total number of 1‐km2 pixels in the study area that exceeded the severe thresholds for VIL, UVIL and Z7. The severe thunderstorm algorithms were found to be very effective at correctly identifying the observed severe thunderstorm events. All three radar parameters indicated a diurnal cycle, with severe convection starting after noon and peaking between 16:00 and 18:00 Local Daylight Time. A positive correlation was evident between the observed storm severity and the daily UVIL and Z7 pixel counts. The daily UVIL and Z7 pixel counts were also positively correlated with the Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) calculated from proximity soundings.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Performance indicators (PIs) in higher education have focused chiefly on research outputs. They have largely ignored the teaching function of universities and colleges. This article outlines the development of a student evaluation instrument designed to measure the teaching performance of academic organisational units. The theory of teaching and learning that underlies the Course Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) is described. The instrument's statistical qualities and its ability to discriminate intelligibly between different courses are discussed in the context of results from national trials in Australian higher education. The principal conclusion reached is that the CEQ offers a reliable, verifiable and useful means of determining the perceived teaching quality of academic units in systems of higher education that are based on British models. Several technical and political issues remain unresolved in its application as a PI.},

This new work explores climatologies of thunderstorm occurrence as seen by LIS and the conditional mean flash rates when thunderstorms do occur. The region where thunderstorms are seen most often by LIS extends slightly farther east in central Africa than the corresponding region with the highest total mean annual flash rates. Presumably this reflects a difference between more frequent thunderstorm initiation in the east and upscale growth as storms move westward. There are some differences between locations with the greatest total lightning flash counts and those where thunderstorms occur most often. The greatest conditional mean flash rates—considering only those TRMM orbits that do have lightning in a given grid box—are found in subtropical regions. The highest values are in Argentina...},

abstract = {Planetary boundary layer (PBL) processes control energy, water, and pollutant exchanges between the surface and free atmosphere. However, there is no observationbased global PBL climatology for evaluation of climate, weather, and air quality models or for characterizing PBL variability on large space and time scales. As groundwork for such a climatology, we compute PBL height by seven methods, using temperature, potential temperature, virtual potential temperature, relative humidity, specific humidity, and refractivity profiles from a 10 year, 505 station radiosonde data set. Six methods are directly compared; they generally yield PBL height estimates that differ by several hundred meters. Relative humidity and potential temperature gradient methods consistently give higher PBL heights, whereas the parcel (or mixing height) method yields significantly lower heights that show larger and more consistent diurnal and seasonal variations (with lower nighttime and wintertime PBLs). Seasonal and diurnal patterns are sometimes associated with local climatological phenomena, such as nighttime radiation inversions, the trade inversion, and tropical convection and associated cloudiness. Surface based temperature inversions are a distinct type of PBL that is more common at night and in the morning than during midday and afternoon, in polar regions than in the tropics, and in winter than other seasons. PBL height estimates are sensitive to the vertical resolution of radiosonde data; standard sounding data yield higher PBL heights than high resolution data. Several sources of both parametric and structural uncertainty in climatological PBL height values are estimated statistically; each can introduce uncertainties of a few 100 m.},

Comparing this ratio with that based on the reanalysis, it is found
that the strength of the SH storm tracks in the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis

abstract = {Assessment of the global burden of disease is based on epidemiological cohort studies that connect premature mortality to a wide range of causes, including the long-term health impacts of ozone and fine particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5). It has proved difficult to quantify premature mortality related to air pollution, notably in regions where air quality is not monitored, and also because the toxicity of particles from various sources may vary. Here we use a global atmospheric chemistry model to investigate the link between premature mortality and seven emission source categories in urban and rural environments. In accord with the global burden of disease for 2010 (ref. 5), we calculate that outdoor air pollution, mostly by PM2.5, leads to 3.3 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.61-4.81) million premature deaths per year worldwide, predominantly in Asia. We primarily assume that all particles are equally toxic, but also include a sensitivity study that accounts for differential toxicity. We find that emissions from residential energy use such as heating and cooking, prevalent in India and China, have the largest impact on premature mortality globally, being even more dominant if carbonaceous particles are assumed to be most toxic. Whereas in much of the USA and in a few other countries emissions from traffic and power generation are important, in eastern USA, Europe, Russia and East Asia agricultural emissions make the largest relative contribution to PM2.5, with the estimate of overall health impact depending on assumptions regarding particle toxicity. Model projections based on a business-as-usual emission scenario indicate that the contribution of outdoor air pollution to premature mortality could double by 2050.},

This paper reflects on the application of nexus thinking through EMFs in South Africa. EMFs are spatially explicit tools geared towards facilitating the integrated management of key issues such as water resources, biodiversity, energy resources and high potential agricultural land.

Aerosol optical depths at different wavelengths, tau(aerlambda), are derived from in situ measurements of the scattering and absorption coefficients and from various radiometric measurements and compared to those derived from the Sun photometer site. The estimates of tau(aerlambda) from the various measurements are shown to be in good agreement. The exception to this is when tau(aerlambda) is derived from the Passive Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer Probe (PCASP), as this method is shown to be extremely sensitive to the pitch angle of the aircraft; therefore, tau(aerlambda) differs for profile ascents and profile descents. However, the aerosol size distribution measured by the PCASP and derived from the AERONET site are in excellent agreement over the 0.05-1.0 mum radius range, which contains the majority of the optically active particles. C-130-derived refractive indices and single scattering albedos are also shown to be in excellent agreement with those derived from the AERONET site. The consistency between in situ and remotely sensed data suggests that, for aerosol well mixed in the vertical, data from AERONET may be used with confidence in validating satellite measurements and modeling studies of the radiative properties and effects of aerosols.},

abstract = {We developed a new tagged species source apportionment (TSSA) algorithm
for tracking the direct mass contributions of selected emissions
sources to the formation of particulates such as aerosol sulfate,
nitrate, ammonium, elemental carbon, and secondary organic aerosols
in the U.S. EPA Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ). The
focus of this paper is on sulfate, nitrate, and elemental carbon.
The objective of the TSSA algorithm is to provide useful results
in modeling studies for identifying important emissions categories
and identifying possible emissions reduction strategies to attain
particulate matter (PM) air quality goals. TSSA differs from model
sensitivity approaches because it tracks direct mass contributions
from specific emissions sources to the total PM concentration at
selected receptor sites, while results from sensitivity approaches
are affected by nonlinear chemistry that can change the concentration
of sulfate, nitrate, and organic carbon secondary particulates. We
evaluated the algorithm by comparing CMAQ/TSSA results with results
from zero-out CMAQ sensitivity simulations. As expected, TSSA results
were almost identical to the CMAQ sensitivity results for chemical
species that do not undergo nonlinear chemical reactions. For chemical
species with nonlinear chemical reaction, the TSSA results are expected
to differ from model sensitivity results, but for small emissions
changes the results are similar in the two approaches. We also compared
CMAQ/TSSA to CAMx/PSAT. Because there are significant differences
in the CMAQ and CAMx model predicted concentrations, the source attribution
results differed for TSSA and PSAT; however, the rank order of emissions
sources were similar for the two approaches at most receptor sites.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the usefulness of on-farm precipitation measurement, through determining spatial and temporal precipitation variability and its effect on corn yield. CERES-Maize (DSSAT version 3.5) was used with three precipitation data sources, for an Indiana farm—an on-farm National Weather Service (NWS) station, the nearest non-urban NWS station with electronic reporting (27 km from the farm), and a weighted mean of the three nearest such stations (27–35 km away)—to simulate 31 years of crop yield on 1-ha grid cells. Described as a percentage of the mean, spatial precipitation variability among the three data sources by corn phenological phase was 21–104{\%}, while temporal (year-to-year) variability was 20–49{\%}. The difference in simulated yield based on spatial precipitation variability was 15.8{\%}, while year-to-year yield variability was 21.5{\%}. The apparent yield difference based on spatial precipitation variability was of the same order as year-to-year variability, which suggests having on-farm precipitation data may be necessary for accurate yield modeling.},

Tests on one month of data from one site show that the algorithms perform accurately and provide products that characterize the essential features of the precipitation climatology. Input to the algorithms are the operationally executed volume scans of a radar and the data from a surrounding rain gauge network. The algorithms separate the radar echoes into convective and stratiform regions, statistically summarize the vertical structure of the radar echoes, and determine precipitation rates and amounts on high spatial resolution. The convective and stratiform regions are separated on the basis of the intensity and sharpness of the peaks of echo intensity. The peaks indicate the centers of the convective region. Precipitation not identified as convective is stratiform. This method avoids the problem of underestimating the stratiform precipitation. The separation criteria are...},

An alternative method of finely milled salt powder is shown to be capable of achieving this goal. During field experiments the use of a sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas tracer to identify the exact seeded cloud volume and to quantify dilution of the seeding agent showed that the seeding agent dilutes to the order of 10−10 of its released concentration in updrafts at a height of ≥1 km above cloud base. This means that the theoretically expected changes in the cloud drop size distribution (DSD) would not be detectable with a cloud droplet spectrometer in a measurement volume collected during the several seconds that the seeded volume is traversed by an aircraft.

This applies to optical imaging probes for particle concentration, size, and projected area spectra measurement. Uncertainty arises should impacting particles shatter and disperse, defeating the intent of the original measurements. Particle shatter is demonstrated in Formvar replicas (University of North Dakota Citation) and video records of particle approach and impact on the Cloudscope (NCAR C-130, NASA DC-8) at airspeeds of 130 and 200 m s−1. Sufficient impact kinetic energy results in drop splash and ice shatter, with conversion to surface energy and ultimately thermal energy through viscous dissipation and ice defect production occurring down to the molecular scale.

abstract = {Aerosols affect clouds in two broad ways: (i) presence of more number of aerosols leads to formation of more smaller droplets, and reduces coalescence, resulting in brighter clouds that reflect more solar energy back to space, hence they contribute to cooling of the Earth's surface and (ii) numerous smaller cloud droplets tend to reduce precipitation and change the extent of cloud cover and increase cloud lifetime and albedo. One of our recent studies on aerosols over the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) relative to the pristine oceans to the south of Indian Ocean showed that highly absorbing aerosols could potentially lead to the revival of active condition preceded by long break. The absorption of solar radiation by aerosols such as black carbon and desert dust produces surface cooling and local stabilization of lower atmosphere. This stability effect is overcome by the enhanced moisture convergence due to the meridional gradient of aerosol-induced heating. In some other studies, we showed association between cloud thickness and cloud to sub-cloud ratio (SCR), aerosol variability (in terms of aerosol optical depth and aerosol index) and monsoon precipitation and climate over regional scale. This paper provides an overview of some salient results that have been obtained from the studies conducted, using the ground- and space-based active and passive remote sensing techniques, at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, India in the recent decade. ?? 2012 2012 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The rotated PCA loading patterns suggest several “preferred” continental-scale rainfall anomaly patterns. The dominant features of year-to-year variations in African rainfall appear to be the high spatial coherence of rainfall anomalies over large portions of the continent. In addition, several dipole regions, that is, adjacent regions which tend to experience rainfall anomalies of opposite sign, are found and discussed. One dipole region, the sub-Saharan region, appears to have a relationship with a characteristic Atlantic sea surface temperature anomaly pattern during boreal summer. During austral summer, the tendency for a large-scale dipole pattern in southeast Africa is apparent, as is an association of this pattern with the warm and cold phases of the El Ni{\~{n}}/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon.

abstract = {Kinematic air parcel trajectory analysis is used to determine patterns of horizontal air transport in 2000 km x 2000 km areas over southern Africa. From these, composite zonal and meridional transport fields are derived for the subcontinent to estimate the extent to which recirculation of air and aerosols may take place in the lower troposphere between the surface and 500 hPa. The nature and degree of recirculation beneath the persistent 500-hPa absolutely stable layer is demonstrated, and transport by recirculation in discrete streams is shown to constitute 44{\%} of the total transport over the region. From a determination of air volume fluxes and estimates of aerosol concentrations, the total mass flux of aerosols by direct transport and by recirculation in conditions during which semipermanent, subtropical, continental anticyclones prevail is estimated to be about 51 Mton yr(-1) in the surface-to-500-hPa layer. Recirculation comprises approximately 22 Mton yr(-1) of this amount. Of the recirculated transport, about 5 Mton yr(-1) is recirculated to the west in easterly transport and 17 Mton yr(-1) to the east in westerly transport. [References: 55]},

These are reviewed here with attention to sustainability of cities, applications that use climate information, and scientific understanding in relation to measurements and modelling. Consideration is given from street (micro) scale to neighbourhood (local) to city and region (meso) scale. Those areas where improvements are needed in the next decade to ensure more sustainable cities are identified. Highpriority recommendations are made in the following six strategic areas: observations, data, understanding, modelling, tools and education. These include the need for more operational urban measurement stations and networks; for an international data archive to aid translation of research findings into design tools, along with guidelines for different climate zones and land uses; to develop methods to analyse atmospheric data measured above complex urban surfaces; to improve short-range, high-resolution numerical prediction of weather, air quality and chemical dispersion through improved modelling of the biogeophysical features of the urban land surface; to improve education about urban meteorology; and to encourage communication across scientific disciplines at a range of spatial and temporal scales. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier.},

abstract = {Unlike other heavy metals that are inherently associated with atmospheric aerosols, mercury in ambient air exists predominantly in the gaseous elemental form. Because of its prolonged atmospheric residence time, elemental mercury vapor is distributed on a global scale. Recently, Canadian researchers have discovered that total gaseous mercury levels in the lower tropospheric boundary layer in the Canadian Arctic are often significantly depleted during the months after polar sunrise. A possible explanation may involve oxidation of elemental mercury, followed by adsorption and deposition of the oxidized form, leading to an increased input of atmospheric mercury into the Arctic ecosystem. Here we present the first continuous high-time-resolution measurements of total gaseous mercury in the Antarctic covering a 12-month period between January 2000 and January 2001 at the German Antarctic research station Neumayer (70 degrees 39' S, 8 degrees 15' W). We report that mercury depletion events also occur in the Antarctic after polar sunrise and compare our measurements with a data setfrom Alert, Nunavut, Canada. We also present indications that BrO radicals and ozone play a key role in the boundary-layer chemistry during springtime mercury depletion events in the Antarctic troposphere.},

abstract = {Attempts are made to study the seasonal climatology of the Arabian Peninsula, including the regional to station level information for Saudi Arabia for the period 1979-2009. The wet (November to April) and dry (June to September) season rainfall and temperature climatology are obtained from various data sources, namely, surface observations, CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP), Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). These gridded datasets detect the dry zone over the Rub Al-Khali, the world's largest sand desert, during the wet season. In this season, large rain belts exist north of 30°N and south of 15°N. During the dry season, the Arabian Peninsula is almost entirely dry north of 15°N but rain belts exist below this latitudinal boundary. Irrespective of the season or dataset used, a relatively heavy-rain area is obtained for the southwest of the Peninsula. The wet (dry) season temperature is highest over the western (middle to the northern) parts of the Peninsula.Surface observations indicate that, irrespective of season, rainfall insignificantly increased in the first period (1979-1993), and then significantly decreased in the second period (1994-2009). The decrease rate is 35.1. mm (5.5. mm) per decade during the wet (dry) season. The temperature over Saudi Arabia has increased significantly, and the increase rate is faster (0.72. °C per decade) in the dry season compared to the wet season (0.51. °C per decade). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Two case studies are presented of aircraft measurements (ozone, NOy,
CO, and meteorological parameters) in the vicinity of fronts located
over the eastern side of the North Atlantic Ocean during spring 1994.
The aim of these studies was twofold: (1) to investigate whether
frontal circulations can transport ozone from the boundary layer
to the free troposphere in well-defined layer; and (2) to ascertain
whether or not conveyor belts associated with extratropical cyclones
exhibit well-defined chemical signatures. The first case study (March
2, 1994) sampled a well-defined ozone-enhanced layer within the free
troposphere. It is demonstrated that this air was transferred from
the boundary layer to the free troposphere during the development
of a baroclinic wave. Two warm conveyor belts sampled within this
flight (one associated with the developing baroclinic wave and the
other with a mature low-pressure system) displayed clear and contrasting
chemical signatures, a consequence of their geographically different
origins. During the second case study (April 25, 1994), both the
dry intrusion and the warm conveyor belt of a mature, occluded low-pressure
system were sampled. Their chemical signatures (in particular, that
of the dry intrusion) showed that interleaving of the two airstreams
had occurred, probably in the vicinity of the occluded front. It
is thus demonstrated that chemical measurements within conveyor belts
provide valuable information on the nature, history, and extent of
these coherent flows.},

The instrument is rugged, of low cost, uses low power, and is easily integrated into various platforms. The high size resolution and the 1.6 l min–1 sample rate provide excellent count statistics and high sensitivity for ambient out-of-cloud aircraft measurements and for other diverse applications. It can be readily configured for isokinetic or subisokinetic aircraft sampling. Initial comparison with other optical particle counters over the Sea of Japan reveals it to be an effective instrument for in situ aircraft measurements.},

This research has been carried out under the auspices of an ongoing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assessment effort to increase scientific understanding of the multiple complex interactions among climate, emissions, atmospheric chemistry, and air quality. The ultimate goal is to enhance the ability of air quality managers to consider global change in their decisions through improved characterization of the potential effects of global change on air quality, including O3. The results discussed here are interim, representing the first phase of the EPA assessment. The aim in this first phase was to consider the effects of climate change alone on air quality, without accompanying changes in anthropogenic emissions of precursor pollutants.

The model also relates vertical motion and precipitation to the origin and vertical displacement of the airstreams and attaches special significance to airstream boundaries, which manifest themselves as sharp discontinuities in cloud and weather patterns.},

abstract = {Abstract The First ATSR Tropical Experiment was carded out in November 1991 over the tropical Atlantic to validate daytime measurements of sea surface temperature (SST) made by the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) on the European remote sensing satellite, ERS-1. An airborne infrared radiometer with channels at 11 and 12 µm spectrally matched to those on the ATSR was used to make nadir, 60° to nadir, and zenith view radiance measurements at a number of different altitudes from 70 m to 8 km above the sea surface. The effect of stratospheric aerosols on the ATSR radiances, due to the June 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, was quantified as nadir view brightness temperature deficits of up to 0.6 K at 11 µm. ATSR retrievals of SST (using both nadir and forward views) were compared with SSTs inferred from low-level radiance measurements of the sea surface that were unaffected by atmospheric absorption. ATSR SSTs retrieved using the nadir only views had negative (i.e., cold) biases of about 2 K. If the forw...},

abstract = {The effective management of mine tailings involves the control of several environmental impacts and legal requirements. Six tailings site management and closure scenarios were developed for a copper zinc underground mine located in Quebec (Canada) and compared using life cycle assessment (LCA). Two options are considered for the mine operation: tailings can be sent to the tailings disposal area where they are submerged or they can be partly used for backfilling. For each of these two operation options, three alternatives are presented for mine closure: (a) submerged tailings, (b) partial desulphurization with a cover of desulphurized material and (c) a cover with capillary barrier effects (CCBE) made of natural soils followed by revegetation. The goals of the study were to draw the inventory of these management scenarios from the development to the post-closure phase, to assess and compare their environmental impacts and to determine the importance of the land-use impact category. The potential impacts for each scenario were evaluated using the IMPACT 2002+ LCIA method. The results of the performed LCA indicate that for mine development and operation, scenarios where tailings are partly used as backfill for underground stopes appear to lead to larger impacts in 11 of the 14 midpoint categories since the backfill plant operation consumes a greater amount of material and energy. For a site closure period of 2 years, the CCBE option creates the greatest impacts, since it requires much more effort than the other techniques. The results for the post-closure phase have been analysed separately since they have a larger uncertainty. They appear to modify the comparative assessment results. The various results presented in the paper show the importance of taking land-use impacts into account.},

abstract = {The Waterberg Coalfield, located in the Limpopo Province (north-western area) of South Africa, contains a significant proportion of the South African coal resource. This Permian coalfield typically contains high vitrinite, high ash coals in the Kungurian Grootegeluk Formation, and high inertinite, low ash coals in the Artinskian Vryheid Formation. Four run-of-mine coals and density fractioned samples were analysed to determine their trace element content. The concentrations of most trace elements in the run-of-mine coals exceed the global averages and certain global ranges, and generally exceed values reported for other South African coalfields. Specifically, Hg concentrations are high to very high in all the coals (up to 2.43. ppm in a sample from the Vryheid Formation), Cd and Se concentrations are comparable to or lower than global averages, and As is very low in the Vryheid Formation (1.57. ppm). A sample from the Grootegeluk Formation is enriched in siderophile elements, and a sample from the Vryheid Formation is depleted in chalcophile elements. Studies of the density fractionated samples indicate that Cd exhibits an organic affinity in the Grootegeluk Formation samples, and possibly a pyritic (or sulphide) affinity in the Vryheid Formation sample. Selenium has a greater affinity for the middle, clay-rich density fractions in all samples. Arsenic reports to the mineral-rich sink fractions, specifically the fractions enriched in pyrite. Mercury reports to both the float and sink fractions, indicating an organic and inorganic affinity in these coals, although there is more enrichment in the sink fractions in the Grootegeluk Formation samples, and a definite organic correlation in the Vryheid Formation sample. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, we provide a meteorological overview of this outbreak and illustrate that the event was composed of three mesoscale events: a large early morning quasi-linear convective system (QLCS), a midday QLCS, and numerous afternoon supercell storms. The main data sources include NWS and research radars, profilers, surface measurements, and photos and videos of the tornadoes.

abstract = {A number of tools are available today - and more are currently being developed - to discriminate, within a particular storm, areas with hail precipitation using data provided by conventional meteorological radar systems. However, at a supraregional level most of the methods that have traditionally been employed to identify hailstorms often obtain ambiguous results. On the other hand, many currently available systems for data extraction and processing make it relatively easy to calculate a large number of variables derived from radar parameters for each storm analyzed and at different stages in its development. The questions are now: is it possible to select and/or classify these variables according to their ability to discriminate hailstorms from non-hail storms? And if so, would the combination of several of these variables enable us to develop new and improved discriminating tools? These questions have prompted the use of mathematical methods for discrimination, such as logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis. In both models the stepwise method was used to construct the mathematical equation automatically. Data from a C-band radar system installed in the NW of the Iberian Peninsula were used to set up the two models. The two models share a number of variables (VIL, maximum reflectivity, height of the maximum reflectivity and ddBZ{\_}max/dt.), but the discriminant model makes use additionally of the top and the tilt of the storm. The results have been assessed not only in terms of the precision indices (the models have a probability of detection of 84.9{\%} and 86.8{\%}, respectively), but also with respect to their accuracy, sufficiency relation, resolution and discrimination. Finally, the logistic model has been calibrated for S-band radar systems. The results show a very satisfactory probability of detection, demonstrating that these methods may also be effective in this type of system. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Phase changes of sea salt particles alter their physical and chemical properties, which is significant for Earth's chemistry and energy budget. In this study, a continuous flow diffusion chamber is used to investigate deliquescence, homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation between 242 K and 215 K, of four salts: pure NaCl, pure MgCl2, synthetic sea water salt, and salt distilled from sampled sea water. Anhydrous particles, aqueous droplets, and ice particles were discriminated using a polarization-sensitive optical particle counter coupled with a machine learning analysis technique. The measured onset deliquescence relative humidities agree with previous studies, where sea water salts deliquescence at lower humidities than pure NaCl. Deliquesced salt droplets homogenously freeze when the relative humidity reaches a sufficiently high value at temperatures below 233 K. From 224 K and below, deposition nucleation freezing on a fraction of NaCl particles was observed at humidities lower than the deliquescence relative humidity. At these low temperatures, otherwise unactivated salt particles deliquesced at the expected deliquescence point, followed by homogeneous freezing at temperatures as low as 215 K. Thus, the observed sea salt particles exhibit a triad of temperature-dependent behaviors. First, they act as cloud condensation particles (CCNs) {\textgreater} 233 K, second they can be homogeneous freezing nuclei (HFNs) {\textless} 233 K, and finally they act as ice nucleating particles (INPs) for heterogeneous nucleation {\textless} 224 K.},

We argue that progress has been impeded by the fact that software has not been developed and shared as a community.Recently, the situation has been changing. In this paper, the developers of a number of open-source software (OSS) projects highlight the potential of OSS to advance radar-related research. We argue that the community-based development of OSS holds the potential to reduce duplication of efforts and to create transparency in implemented algorithms while improving the quality and scope of the software. We also conclude that there is sufficiently mature technology to support collaboration across different software projects. This could allow for consolidation toward a set of interoperable software platforms, each designed to accommodate very specific user requirements.},

abstract = {Actions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions often reduce co-emitted air pollutants, bringing co-benefits for air quality and human health. Past studies(1-6) typically evaluated near-term and local co-benefits, neglecting the long-range transport of air pollutants(7-9), long-term demographic changes, and the influence of climate change on air quality(10-12). Here we simulate the co-benefits of global GHG reductions on air quality and human health using a global atmospheric model and consistent future scenarios, via two mechanisms: a) reducing co-emitted air pollutants, and b) slowing climate change and its effect on air quality. We use new relationships between chronic mortality and exposure to fine particulate matter(13) and ozone(14), global modeling methods(15), and new future scenarios(16). Relative to a reference scenario, global GHG mitigation avoids 0.5±0.2, 1.3±0.5, and 2.2±0.8 million premature deaths in 2030, 2050, and 2100. Global average marginal co-benefits of avoided mortality are {\$}50-380 (ton CO2)(-1), which exceed previous estimates, exceed marginal abatement costs in 2030 and 2050, and are within the low range of costs in 2100. East Asian co-benefits are 10-70 times the marginal cost in 2030. Air quality and health co-benefits, especially as they are mainly local and near-term, provide strong additional motivation for transitioning to a low-carbon future.},

Potassium salts and organic particles were the predominant species in the smoke, and most were internally mixed. More KCl particles occur in young smoke, whereas more K2SO4 and KNO3 particles were present in aged smoke. This change indicates that with the aging of the smoke, KCl particles from the fires were converted to K2SO4 and KNO3 through reactions with sulfur- and nitrogen- bearing species from biomass burning as well as other sources. More soot was present in smoke from flaming grass fires than bush and wood fires, probably due to the predominance of flaming combustion in grass fires. The high abundance of organic particles and soluble salts can affect the hygroscopic properties of biomass-burning aerosols and therefore influence their role as cloud condensation nuclei. Particles from biomass burning were important constituents of the regional hazes.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Dust storms are considered to be a natural hazard over the Arabian Peninsula, since they occur all year round with maximum intensity and frequency in Spring and Summer. The Regional Climate Model version 4 (RegCM4) has been used to study the climatology of atmospheric dust over the Arabian Peninsula from 1999 to 2012. This relatively long simulation period samples the meteorological conditions that determine the climatology of mineral dust aerosols over the Arabian Peninsula. The modeled Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) has been compared against ground-based observations of three Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations that are distributed over the Arabian Peninsula and daily space based observations from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), the Moderate resolution Imaging SpectroRadimeter (MODIS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The large scale atmospheric circulation and the land surface response that lead to dust uplifting have been analyzed. While the modeled AOD shows that the dust season extends from March to August with two pronounced maxima, one over the northern Arabian Peninsula in March with AOD equal to 0.4 and one over the southern Arabian Peninsula in July with AOD equal to 0.7, the observations show that the dust season extends from April to August with two pronounced maxima, one over the northern Arabian Peninsula in April with AOD equal to 0.5 and one over the southern Arabian Peninsula in July with AOD equal to 0.5. In spring a high pressure dominates the Arabian Peninsula and is responsible for advecting dust from southern and western part of the Arabian Peninsula to northern and eastern part of the Peninsula. Also, fast developed cyclones in northern Arabian Peninsula are responsible for producing strong dust storms over Iraq and Kuwait. However, in summer the main driver of the surface dust emission is the strong northerly wind ("Shamal") that transport dust from the northern Arabian Peninsula toward south parallel to the Arabian Gulf. The AERONET shortwave Top of Atmosphere Radiative Forcing (TOARF) and at the Bottom of Atmosphere Radiative Forcing (BOARF) have been analyzed and compared with the modeled direct radiative forcing of mineral dust aerosol. The annual modeled TOARF and BOARF are {\&}minus;3.3 and −12 W m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, respectively. However, the annual observed TOARF and BOARF are significantly different at {\&}minus;10 and −52 W m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, respectively. The analysis of observed and modeled TOARF agrees with previous studies in highlighting the need for more accurate specification of surface albedo over the region. Due to the high surface albedo of the central Arabian Peninsula, mineral dust aerosols tend to warm the atmosphere in summer (June–August).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Theoretical models exist for horizontal stratified atmospheres without clouds and currently becoming available are the first three-dimensional models that include broken cloud conditions. The experimental database for model verification is scarce for both ground and vertical distribution. To close this experimental gap an airborne system was developed and is described in this paper. An ultralight aircraft was used as an instrument platform to provide detailed measurements of radiation transfer in the ultraviolet and complimentary parameters that can be used for comparison with model calculations. The measurement system consists of standard, but in size and power consumption strongly modified, instruments. It produces a dataset covering upwelling and downwelling radiation as well as absorbing gase...},

The elements of antiparallel {\&}{\#}946;-structure take origin from the hydrophobic core formed by the disulfides. The {\&}{\#}946;-strands adopt the shape of the three loops, giving the name of the fold. While neurotoxins (NTs) - also TF proteins from snake venom - exert their effect through specific interactions with protein receptors, no specific protein target has been found for CTs. Unlike NTs, CTs are amphiphilic and cytotoxic against a variety of cells, including cancer ones. Thus, the hypothesis that the activity of CTs is caused by their interactions with lipid membranes is currently central. To understand molecular basis behind variations in toxicities of CTs highly homologous in their sequences, detailed knowledge of their structure and dynamics is required. The present review summarizes experimental and computational data on the spatial organization of CTs and their dynamics in various environments (aqueous solution, membranous milieus).},

abstract = {Four cloud-seeding cases over southern Idaho during the 2010/11 winter season have been simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model using the coupled silver iodide (AgI) cloud-seeding scheme that was described in Part I. The seeding effects of both ground-based and airborne seeding as well as the impacts of model physics, seeding rates, location, timing, and cloud properties on seeding effects have been investigated. The results were compared with those from Part I and showed the following: 1) For the four cases tested in this study, control simulations driven by the Real-Time Four Dimensional Data Assimilation (RTFDDA) WRF forecast data generated more realistic atmospheric conditions and precipitation patterns than those driven by the North America Regional Reanalysis data. Sensitivity experiments therefore used the RTFDDA data. 2) Glaciogenic cloud seeding increased orographic precipitation by less than 1{\%} over the simulation domain, including the Snake River basin, and by up to 5{\%}over the target areas. The local values of the relative precipitation enhancement by seeding were ;20{\%}. Most of the enhancement came from vapor depletion. 3) The seeding effect was inversely related to the natural precipitation efficiency but was positively related to seeding rates. 4) Airborne seeding is generally more efficient than ground-based seeding in terms of targeting, but its efficiency depends on local meteorological conditions. 5) The normalized seeding effects ranged from 0.4 to 1.6 under various conditions for a certain seeding event. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Actions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions often reduce co-emitted air pollutants, bringing co-benefits for air quality and human health. Past studies(1-6) typically evaluated near-term and local co-benefits, neglecting the long-range transport of air pollutants(7-9), long-term demographic changes, and the influence of climate change on air quality(10-12). Here we simulate the co-benefits of global GHG reductions on air quality and human health using a global atmospheric model and consistent future scenarios, via two mechanisms: a) reducing co-emitted air pollutants, and b) slowing climate change and its effect on air quality. We use new relationships between chronic mortality and exposure to fine particulate matter(13) and ozone(14), global modeling methods(15), and new future scenarios(16). Relative to a reference scenario, global GHG mitigation avoids 0.5±0.2, 1.3±0.5, and 2.2±0.8 million premature deaths in 2030, 2050, and 2100. Global average marginal co-benefits of avoided mortality are {\$}50-380 (ton CO2)(-1), which exceed previous estimates, exceed marginal abatement costs in 2030 and 2050, and are within the low range of costs in 2100. East Asian co-benefits are 10-70 times the marginal cost in 2030. Air quality and health co-benefits, especially as they are mainly local and near-term, provide strong additional motivation for transitioning to a low-carbon future.},

@article{tyson_1998,
abstract = {A pall of aerosols and trace gases frequently occurs over southern Africa to a depth of {\&}500 hPa, blanketing vast areas, particularly in the austral winter and spring. Large-scale offshore transport of these aerosols and trace gases in extremely large plumes from interior continental areas of the subcontinent to the Indian and Atlantic Oceans is a common occurrence. The nature of the transport plumes, their climatology, chemical composition and morphology are discussed. In the vertically integrated, surface-to-500 hPa layer, poleward of about 15 S, transport into the Indian Ocean is shown to be about 60{\%} greater into the Indian Ocean than into the Atlantic Ocean. Recirculation of atmospheric constituents is considered and estimates of aerosol mass fluxes over central southern Africa are presented. Of the total of about 50 Mt yr of aerosols being transported at the central meridian, 44{\%} is shown to be recirculated material. The rest exits the subcontinent directly without recirculation. Preferred plume corridors of exit and entry are postulated for different localities on the east and west coasts. Two case studies of east- and west-coast plumes apparently flowing uniformly out of southern Africa are examined. The illusion of uniformity in plume structure is shown to be misleading. Both plumes are shown to be above and separated from the marine boundary layer. Each is over 1500 km in width and 35 km deep. Likewise, both are capped by absolutely stable layers at {\&}500 hPa and exhibit a complex structure of both outflowing aerosols and trace gases and inflowing, recycled and recirculated material. Indications of the composition of the recirculated material are given and implications of the plume transports are considered.},

@article{Almazroui2015a,
abstract = {? 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.This work identifies a total of 1,992 cyclone tracks over the East Mediterranean region using six hourly sea level pressure fields taken from National Center for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis for the period 1958?2010. A classification method is developed to classify the long-track cyclones into four key routes. Besides these, two other routes are considered, which are classified as either stationary or having a short track length. This study reveals that the East Mediterranean region has three main cyclogenesis areas and four main cyclolysis areas. Analysis of the relationships between the main cyclogenesis and cyclolysis areas indicates that the Anatolian Mountain region generates the largest number of cyclones and that they terminate in four cyclolysis areas. It is also found that 19.0, 29.4, and 51.6?{\%} of the cyclones are stationary, short, and long tracks, respectively, while only 1.6?{\%} of the cyclones are explosive. The average lifetime of the tracks is between 2 and 3?days, although a few live up to 5 or 6?days. The study of the synoptic composition of the routes indicates that the East Mediterranean cyclones are controlled by two key processes: (i) the possibility of merging tracks with low pressure systems over the Arabian Peninsula and (ii) the extensions of both the Azores and the Siberian highs into the East Mediterranean, as well as by the wind speeds in the upper atmosphere.},

@article{Soderholm2017,
abstract = {The Southeast Queensland (SEQ) region of Australia is recognised for frequent thunderstorms documented through numerous studies including high impact severe thunderstorm cases which have caused insured losses exceeding {\$}1 billion AUD. Despite a modest body of scientific literature, basic questions regarding the role of climate, synoptic and local-scale ({\textless}10 km) processes affecting the variability of thunderstorms still remain. In an effort to advance these questions as part of the Coastal Convective Interactions Experiment (CCIE), this study integrates multiple datasets across an 18-year period (July 1997 – June 2015) to provide a mesoscale climatological analysis of the SEQ hailstorms and associated environmental conditions. On a multi-year time scale, the relationship between the El-Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation and hailstorm frequency is consistent with previous studies. On synoptic scales, a southeasterly change situation coupled with a sea breeze was found to provide the most favourable environment for hailstorms, particularly for southwest SEQ. On the local-scale, hail development within convective cells was found to be most frequent within the inland limb of maritime air mass on sea breeze days. This observation suggests the sea breeze air masses may become favourable for convection after sufficient modification during inland propagation.},

abstract = {Vertical profiles in the lower troposphere of temperature, relative humidity, sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), condensation nuclei (CN), and carbon monoxide (CO), and horizontal distributions of twenty gaseous and particulate species, are presented for five regions of southern Africa during the dry biomass burning season of 2000. The regions are the semiarid savannas of northeast South Africa and northern Botswana, the savanna-forest mosaic of coastal Mozambique, the humid savanna of southern Zambia, and the desert of western Namibia. The highest average concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), CO, methane (CH4), O3, black particulate carbon, and total particulate carbon were in the Botswana and Zambia sectors (388 and 392 ppmv, 369 and 453 ppbv, 1753 and 1758 ppbv, 79 and 88 ppbv, 2.6 and 5.5 micrograms /cubic meter and 13.2 and 14.3 micrograms/cubic meter). This was due to intense biomass burning in Zambia and surrounding regions. The South Africa sector had the highest average concentrations of SO2, sulfate particles, and CN (5.1 ppbv, 8.3 micrograms/cubic meter, and per 6400 cubic meter , respectively), which derived from biomass burning and electric generation plants and mining operations within this sector. Air quality in the Mozambique sector was similar to the neighboring South Africa sector. Over the arid Namibia sector there were polluted layers aloft, in which average SO2, O3, and CO mixing ratios (1.2 ppbv, 76 ppbv, and 3 10 ppbv, respectively) were similar to those measured over the other more polluted sectors. This was due to transport of biomass smoke from regions of widespread savanna burning in southern Angola. Average concentrations over all sectors of CO2 (386 8 ppmv), CO (261 81 ppbv), SO2 (2.5 1.6 ppbv), O3 (64 13 ppbv), black particulate carbon (2.3 1.9 microgram/cubic meter), organic particulate carbon (6.2 5.2 microgram/cubic meter), total particle mass (26.0 4.7 microgram/cubic meter), and potassium particles (0.4 0.1 microgram/cubic meter) were comparable to those in polluted, urban air. Since the majority of the measurements in this study were obtained in locations well removed from industrial sources of pollution, the high average concentrations of pollutants reflect the effects of widespread biomass burning. On occasions, relatively thin (-0.5 km) layers of remarkably clean air were located at -3 km above mean sea level, sandwiched between heavily polluted air. The data presented here can be used for inputs to and validation of regional and global atmospheric chemical models.},

abstract = {Clouds and precipitation play crucial roles in the Earth's energy balance, global atmospheric circulation and the availability of fresh water. Aerosols may modify cloud properties and precipitation formation by modifying the concentration and size of cloud droplets, and consequently the strength of cloud convection, and height of glaciation levels thus affecting precipitation patterns. Here we evaluate the aerosol effect on clouds, using large statistics of daily satellite data over the North Atlantic Ocean. We found a strong correlation between the presence of aerosols and the structural properties of convective clouds. These correlations suggest systematic invigoration of convective clouds by pollution, desert dust and biomass burning aerosols.

Severe thunderstorms were observed ahead of a surface cold front, including a (Southern Hemisphere) cyclonic left-moving supercell that produced a multiple-vortex tornado in the outskirts of the town of Indaiatuba, Brazil (23.1°S, 47.2°W). A documentation of the multivortex structure of the tornado and of the cloud-base features is performed using still images from a video that recorded the event. Characteristics of the tornadic thunderstorm and the synoptic-scale environment in which it developed are examined using Doppler radar data, geostationary satellite imagery, surface and upper-air observations, and data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction's Climate Forecast System Reanalysis. The cloud base of the thunderstorm displayed morphological features associated with midlatitude tornadic supercells, including a low-level mesocyclone and a “clear slot”...},

abstract = {Simulations performed with general circulation models and a model
of intermediate complexity show that the variability of the September
sea ice extent in the Arctic of the 21st century increases first
when the mean extent decreases from present-day values. A maximum
of the variance is found when the mean September ice extent is around
3 million km2. For lower extents, the variance declines with the
mean extent. The behavior is clearly different in Antarctica where
the variance always decreases as the mean ice extent decreases, following
roughly a square-root law compatible with very simple geometric arguments.
Several mechanisms are responsible for the non-linear behavior of
the Arctic. However, the strong interhemispheric contrast suggests
that the difference in geometrical setting, with an open ocean in
the south and a semi-closed basin in the north, plays a significant
role.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosols are intricately linked to the climate system and to the hydrologic cycle. The net effect of aerosols is to cool the climate system by reflecting sunlight. Depending on their composition, aerosols can also absorb sunlight in the atmosphere, further cooling the surface but warming the atmosphere in the process. These effects of aerosols on the temperature profile, along with the role of aerosols as cloud condensation nuclei, impact the hydrologic cycle, through changes in cloud cover, cloud properties and precipitation. Unravelling these feedbacks is particularly difficult because aerosols take a multitude of shapes and forms, ranging from desert dust to urban pollution, and because aerosol concentrations vary strongly over time and space. To accurately study aerosol distribution and composition therefore requires continuous observations from satellites, networks of ground-based instruments and dedicated field experiments. Increases in aerosol concentration and changes in their composition, driven by industrialization and an expanding population, may adversely affect the Earth's climate and water supply.},

abstract = {Megacities and other major population centers represent large, concentrated sources of anthropogenic pollutants to the atmosphere, with consequences for both local air quality and for regional and global atmospheric chemistry. The tradeoffs between the regional buildup of pollutants near their sources versus long-range export depend on meteorological characteristics which vary as a function of geographical location and season. Both horizontal and vertical transport contribute to pollutant export, and the overall degree of export is strongly governed by the lifetimes of pollutants. We provide a first quantification of these tradeoffs and the main factors influencing them in terms of "regional pollution potentials", metrics based on simulations of representative tracers using the 3-D global model MATCH (Model of Atmospheric Transport and Chemistry). The tracers have three different lifetimes (1, 10, and 100 days) and are emitted from 36 continental large point sources. Several key features of the export characteristics emerge. For instance, long-range near-surface pollutant export is generally strongest in the middle and high latitudes, especially for source locations in Eurasia, for which 17–34{\%} of a tracer with a 10-day lifetime is exported beyond 1000 km and still remains below 1 km altitude. On the other hand, pollutant export to the upper troposphere is greatest in the tropics, due to transport by deep convection, and for six source locations, more than 50{\%} of the total mass of the 10-day lifetime tracer is found above 5 km altitude. Furthermore, not only are there order of magnitude interregional differences, such as between low and high latitudes, but also often substantial intraregional differences, which we discuss in light of the regional meteorological characteristics. We also contrast the roles of horizontal dilution and vertical mixing in reducing the pollution buildup in the regions including and surrounding the sources. For some regions such as Eurasia, dilution due to long-range horizontal transport governs the local and regional pollution buildup; however, on a global basis, differences in vertical mixing are dominant in determining the pollution buildup both around and further downwind of the source locations.},

abstract = {Hail growth is studied in the Westplains, Colorado, storm for which a variety of observations were collected. Measurements from a triple-Doppler radar network and a penetrating aircraft are used to synthesize fields of liquid water content and three-dimensional, evolving air motion from which detailed hail growth trajectories are computed. Explicit treatment of the growth of hail embryos is sidestepped. Rather, for the purpose of the study a wide range of embryo sizes is assumed to exist over a broad region of the storm and the analysis examines which particles are predicted to grow and what their growth trajectories are. Sensitivity of individual trajectories to many parameter such as initial position, embryo size, and particle drag law, is found. However, the general results, including the following, are insensitive: the storm flow field is organized such that an efficient mechanism exists for transporting particles into the updraft; following growth of the embryo outside the large updraft, a single pass though the updraft is sufficient to account for hail of the observed maximum size (1.5- 2.0 cm); fall-out positions and growth times are consistent with the observations; growth takes place primarily between -10 and -25°C. A wide variety of interweaving trajectories is predicted. In general they conform to the supercell model of Browning and Foote, though several differences are noted. Hail apparently can grow in the storm from a wide range of initial positions, but the favorable initial region for the smaller and more numerous embryos that are expected to dominate the hail production is more restricted. The width of the updraft is found to be an important factor in limiting hail growth in the storm. Melting during fall-out is also significant. The present results are shown to be consistent with a generalized hailstorm model termed an open-cell simple-trajectory model. By this it is meant that (a) the embryo stage of growth occurs outside the large updraft in which (b) the hail itself grows by making a single traverse, as opposed to following several looping "trajectories. Evidence supporting the general importance of this mode of behavior of hailstorms is presented. Alternative theories using them concepts are also discussed.},

on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same

framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the

abstract = {1 We collected filter samples of the atmospheric aerosol during the Southern African Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI 2000) experiment onboard the UK Met Office C-130 aircraft. The main operational area was the Atlantic Ocean offshore of Namibia and Angola, where biomass-smoke haze at least 1-2 days old was widespread. The size-fractionated aerosol samples were analyzed for the major inorganic ions, carbonaceous material (elemental and organic carbon), and elements with atomic numbers between 11 (Na) and 82 (Pb). The regional haze aerosol was composed mostly of carbonaceous aerosols (on the average, 81{\%} of the submicron mass), with secondary inorganic aerosols (sulfate, ammonium, and nitrate) accounting for another 14{\%}. K+ and Cl-, typical pyrogenic species, constituted only 2{\%} of the mass. The aerosol chemical data were used to estimate mass emission fluxes for various aerosol components. For African savanna/grassland burning, the estimated emission flux of carbonaceous particles (particulate organic matter plus elemental carbon) is 14 1 Tg yr(-1), and that of the nitrogen species (nitrate and ammonium) is 2 2 Tg yr(-1). For the flight segments in regional haze, the mean particle scattering coefficient at 550 nm was sigma(s) = 101 56 Mm(-1) and the mean particle absorption coefficients a at 565 nm averaged 8 5 Mm(-1) (mean single scattering albedo of 0.93 0.06 at 550 nm). The dry mass scattering efficiency alpha(s), calculated from the linear regression of the mean scattering versus the estimated submicron mass, is estimated to be between 4.2 and 4.6 0.6 m(2) g(-1), depending on the assumptions made in calculating the aerosol mass. The dependence of the scattering enhancement ratios Deltasigma(s)/DeltaCO on the distance from the burning regions suggests that the evolution of particle size with time influences the light scattering efficiency. Fresh smoke was sampled during a dedicated flight in the proximity and within the plume of an active biomass burning fire. Here the enhancement ratio with respect to CO of particles in the Aitken-size range (5-100 nm diameter) was DeltaN(Aitken)/DeltaCO similar to25 cm(-3) (STP) ppb(-1). These particles were removed rapidly after emission, and they were not detectable in the regional haze. The enhancement ratio for accumulation mode particles (0.1-1 mm diameter) DeltaN(Acc)/DeltaCO was similar to26-30 cm(-3) (STP) ppb(-1) in young smoke, and 16 3 cm(-3) (STP) ppb(-1) in aged haze, suggesting that the number concentration of accumulation mode particles was reduced by about 41{\%} during aging.},

@article{Retief2008,
abstract = {This paper presents the results of research which evaluated the performance of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) practice in South Africa in order to develop understanding of how SEA functions within a developing country with a voluntary SEA system. The research applied a combination of methods in a mixed research strategy, including a macro level survey of the SEA system together with case study reviews exploring micro level application. Three main 'system features' emerged, namely expansion of voluntary practice, diversity in practice and general ineffectiveness. The results also highlight a number of 'application features' such as a lack of focus due to an inability to deal with the concepts of 'sustainability' and 'significance', as well as poor understanding and integration with decision-making processes. Moreover, it emerged that none of the case studies seem to have conducted an 'assessment' per se, but rather provided a framework for strategic decision-making. The paper puts forward a number of interrelated explanations for these system and application features. In a parallel to the fable of the 'emperor's new clothes', SEA in South Africa appears to be regarded as the answer to all environmental problems, whilst being ineffective in practice.},

Emissions for a uniform standard task — the proposed performance index — were, however, lower for total suspended particulates for the more efficient stoves but higher for CO, indicating that the increases in efficiency were not able to offset the greatly increased CO emission factors.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien. In this paper, a nonhydrostatic Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model has been used to simulate the extreme precipitation event of 25 November 2009, over Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The model is integrated in three nested (27, 9, and 3 km) domains with the initial and boundary forcing derived from the NCEP reanalysis datasets. As a control experiment, the model integrated for 48 h initiated at 0000 UTC on 24 November 2009. The simulated rainfall in the control experiment depicts in well agreement with Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission rainfall estimates in terms of intensity as well as spatio-temporal distribution. Results indicate that a strong low-level (850 hPa) wind over Jeddah and surrounding regions enhanced the moisture and temperature gradient and created a conditionally unstable atmosphere that favored the development of the mesoscale system. The influences of topography and heat exchange process in the atmosphere were investigated on the development of extreme precipitation event; two sensitivity experiments are carried out: one without topography and another without exchange of surface heating to the atmosphere. The results depict that both surface heating and topography played crucial role in determining the spatial distribution and intensity of the extreme rainfall over Jeddah. The topography favored enhanced uplift motion that further strengthened the low-level jet and hence the rainfall over Jeddah and adjacent areas. On the other hand, the absence of surface heating considerably reduced the simulated rainfall by 30{\%} as compared to the observations.},

@article{Hancox2014,
abstract = {For well over a century and a half coal has played a vital role in South Africa's economy and currently bituminous coal is the primary energy source for domestic electricity generation, as well as being the feedstock for the production of a substantial percentage of the country's liquid fuels. It furthermore provides a considerable source of foreign revenue from exports. Based on geographic considerations, and variations in the sedimentation, origin, formation, distribution and quality of the coals, 19 coalfields are generally recognised in South Africa. This paper provides an updated review of their exploration and exploitation histories, general geology, and coal seam nomenclature and coal qualities. Within the various coalfields autocyclic variability is the norm rather than the exception, whereas allocyclic variability is much less so, and allows for the correlation of genetically related sequences. During the mid-Jurassic break up of Gondwana most of the coals bearing successions were intruded by dolerite. These intrusions are important as they may cause devolatilisation and burning of the coal, create structural disturbances and related seam correlation problems, and difficulties in mining operations. Whilst many of the coalfields have been extensively explored and exploited, those in the north of the country have until recently received much less attention. Four coalfields occur partly or wholly within the Limpopo Province of South Africa and these may contain as much as 70{\%} of South Africa's remaining coal resources. These coalfields in particular have been the focus of recent exploration due to the presence of large coking and thermal coal resources, as well as for their coal bed methane potential, resources that need to be unlocked regards to maximum benefit and minimal environmental degradation. South Africa's coals have been also recently addressed as palaeoclimate archives recording Gondwana's postglacial climate amelioration by major changes in land plant communities, and proving high-resolution palyno-stratigraphy as a crucial tool to decipher climate change during the Permo-Carboniferous. This aspect of the coals of South Africa is also reviewed.},

abstract = {Hail processes in deep convection can have a substantial impact on precipitation characteristics as well as on dynamic and thermodynamic properties of convective downdrafts and cold pools, yet the realistic representation of hail in many cloud-resolving models employing bulk microphysical schemes is challenging. The limits imposed by fixing one or two of the distribution parameters in many one- and two-moment bulk microphysics schemes often lead to particularly poor representations of particles within the tails of size distribution spectra; an especially important consideration for hail, which covers a broad range of sizes in nature. In order to improve the representation of hail distributions in simulations of deep moist convection in cloud-resolving numerical models, a new triple-moment bulk hail microphysics scheme (3MHAIL) is presented and evaluated. The 3MHAIL scheme predicts the relative dispersion parameter for a gamma distribution function via prognostication of the sixth moment (related to the reflectivity factor) of the distribution in addition to the mass mixing ratio and number concentration (third and zeroeth moments, respectively) thereby allowing for a fully prognostic distribution function. Significant improvement in the representation of sedimentation, melting, and formation processes of hail are achieved with the 3MHAIL scheme compared to lower-order moment schemes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Water is one of the most basic commodities on earth sustaining human life. In many regions of the world, traditional sources and supplies of ground water, rivers and reservoirs, are either inadequate or under threat from ever-increasing demands on water from changes in land use and growing populations. This has prompted scientists and engineers to explore the possibility of augmenting water supplies by means of cloud seeding. This paper provides an overview of the current scientific status of weather modification activities to enhance pre-cipitation for both glaciogenic and hygroscopic seeding experiments. It is important to emphasize that although funding for scientific studies has decreased substantially during the past decade, operational programs have actually increased. During the last 10 years there has been a thorough scrutiny of past experiments involving experiments using glaciogenic seeding. Although there still exist indications that seeding can increase precipitation, a number of recent studies have questioned many of the positive results, weakening the scientific credibility. As a result, considerable skep-ticism exists as to whether these methods provides a cost-effective means for increasing precipitation for water resources. Recent results from hygroscopic seeding experiments provided for some renewed optimism in the field of precipita-tion enhancement. Although promising results have been obtained to date, some fundamental questions remain that need to be answered in order to provide a sound scientific basis for this technology.},

abstract = {Permian coals of the southern hemisphere are generally considered to contain lower concentrations of sulfides, halogens, and trace elements when compared to northern hemisphere Carboniferous coals. Few studies have considered the trace element content in South African coals, and little or no work has been published for Highveld coals. Of the nineteen coal fields in South Africa, the Highveld coal field is one of the nine currently producing, and is second largest in terms of production. Five run of mine samples and a high ash middlings product from the Number 4 Lower seam were analyzed, totaling six sample sets. Fourteen trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, V, and Zn) were selected for this study based on the global perception that these elements may be hazardous to human health and/or the environment when they are released during coal utilization. Several sample preparation techniques were tested using certified reference materials (SARMs 18, 19 and 20) to determine the most repeatable technique for these coals. The samples were analyzed by ICP-AES and CVAA (Hg only). Microwave digestion proved to be generally unreliable despite the utilization of several different methods. A slurry direct injection method into the ICP-AES provided good correlations with the reference material, but requires further development to enhance the confidence level in this relatively unexplored technique. Samples prepared based on three ASTM standards for the determination of trace elements in coal provided repeatable results in most instances, and were the preparation methods utilized for the Highveld coals. The trace element values determined for the Highveld coals are generally in good agreement with values available in literature for South African coals, with the exception of Hg, Mn and Cr. Hg values reported here are lower, Cr and Mn higher. Results generally agree well with analyses on the same samples conducted by the United States Geological Survey. When considering the global ranges for trace elements, the Highveld range values are within Swaine's range boundaries with the exception of Cr. Compared to the cited global average values for the fourteen trace elements determined, the values obtained for the Highveld coals generally fall below or well below these average values, with the exception of Cr and Mn. Concentrations of Cd and Cu are lower compared to global average values, and As, Mo, Pb, Se, Sb, and Zn can be considered low to very low. Arsenic is ten times lower compared to typical USA values. Concentrations of Co and Ni are similar to global averages, with V and Hg being very slightly higher. The middlings samples reported higher concentrations of most elements, related to the higher ash content of these samples. Of interest, the chalcophile elements determined are all depleted in the Highveld coals compared to global averages, and the siderophile elements are enriched or comparable to global averages. Risk-based health studies in the USA on coals with similar or higher Hg and significantly higher As contents have not reported negative health effects, and therefore it could be assumed that the mobilization of these trace elements from the five Highveld coals are unlikely to cause human health problems. Work is ongoing to determine the modes of occurrence of these HAPs and to address the partitioning behaviors and speciation states of these elements during coal utilization. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this context we discuss the issues of radar-rainfall product development, and the theoretical and practical requirements of validating radar-rainfall maps and new radar technologies. We discuss a framework for reflectivity based rainfall estimation, including estimation of uncertainty of radar-rainfall estimates. Validation of radar-rainfall products is a major challenge for broad utilization of these products in hydrologic applications. In the discussion of radar-rainfall prediction we focus on orographically induced extreme rainfall and flooding, discuss the issues of detection, statistical sample size, and scale effects. We conclude the paper with a set of recommendations for research priorities and experimental requirements to address them.},

Despite decades of research, it has proved frustratingly difficult to establish climatically meaningful relationships among the aerosol, clouds and precipitation. As a result, the climatic effect of the aerosol remains controversial. We propose that the difficulty in untangling relationships among the aerosol, clouds and precipitation reflects the inadequacy of existing tools and methodologies and a failure to account for processes that buffer cloud and precipitation responses to aerosol perturbations.},

abstract = {‘Resilience' has risen to prominence across a range of academic disciplines and political discourses. Situating resilience theories in historical context the paper argues that the resilience discourse of complex adaptive systems, for all its utility as a means for conceptualising and managing change, is allied with contemporary governmental discourses that responsibilise risk away from the state and on to individuals and institutions. Further, in arguing that resilience theories originate in two distinct epistemological communities (natural and social science) in its mobilisation as a ‘boundary object' resilience naturalises an ontology of ‘the system'. Resilience approaches increasingly structure, not only academic, but also government policy discourses, with each influencing the development of the other. It is argued that by mobilising ‘the system' as the metaconcept for capturing socio-natural and socio-economic relations resilience theories naturalise and reify two abstractions: firstly, the system itself – enrolling citizens into practices that give it meaning and presence; secondly, the naturalisation of shocks to the system, locating them in a post-political spacewhere the only certainty is uncertainty. With reference to an emerging governmentality through resilience, this paper argues for a critical interrogation of plural resilience theories and wonders at their emancipatory possibilities},

abstract = {A comprehensive, spatially resolved (0.25°×0.25°) fossil fuel consumption database and emissions inventory was constructed, for India, for the first time. Emissions of sulphur dioxide and aerosol chemical constituents were estimated for 1996–1997 and extrapolated to the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) study period (1998–1999). District level consumption of coal/lignite, petroleum and natural gas in power plants, industrial, transportation and domestic sectors was 9411 PJ, with major contributions from coal (54{\%}) followed by diesel (18{\%}). Emission factors for various pollutants were derived using India specific fuel characteristics and information on combustion/air pollution control technologies for the power and industrial sectors. Domestic and transportation emission factors, appropriate for Indian source characteristics, were compiled from literature. SO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion for 1996–1997 were 4.0Tg SO2yr−1, with 756 large point sources (e.g. utilities, iron and steel, fertilisers, cement, refineries and petrochemicals and non-ferrous metals), accounting for 62{\%}. PM2.5 emitted was 0.5 and 2.0Tgyr−1 for the 100{\%} and the 50{\%} control scenario, respectively, applied to coal burning in the power and industrial sectors. Coal combustion was the major source of PM2.5 (92{\%}) primarily consisting of fly ash, accounting for 98{\%} of the “inorganic fraction” emissions (difference between PM2.5 and black carbon+organic matter) of 1.6Tgyr−1. Black carbon emissions were estimated at 0.1Tgyr−1, with 58{\%} from diesel transport, and organic matter emissions at 0.3Tgyr−1, with 48{\%} from brick-kilns. Fossil fuel consumption and emissions peaked at the large point industrial sources and 22 cities, with elevated area fluxes in northern and western India. The spatial resolution of this inventory makes it suitable for regional-scale aerosol-climate studies. These results are compared to previous studies and differences discussed. Measurements of emission factors for Indian sources are needed to further refine these estimates.},

This study used the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 2 approach to calculate greenhouse gas emissions from road transport in South Africa and Lesotho between 2000 and 2009. Key transport emitting sources, trend analysis and modal intensities were determined for the two countries. For South Africa, provincial road transport emissions were calculated from the number of vehicles by vehicle type and distance travelled. Calculations were at a national level in Lesotho. Road transport carbon dioxide equivalent emissions were estimated at 43.5 million tonnes in South Africa and 0.28 million tonnes in Lesotho in 2009. Motorcars and trucks produced 70.6{\%} of the total road transport emissions in South Africa. Road transport emissions increased by approximately 2.6{\%} per year between 2000 and 2009 in South Africa, while they increased by approximately 2.5{\%} per annum in Lesotho over the same period. Gauteng province had the highest emissions, contributing approximately a third of total road transport emissions in South Africa; while the Northern Cape contributed only 2{\%}. Minibus taxis were the most efficient transport mode on the basis of load carried. The Northern Cape had the highest emissions per passenger-kilometres and tonne-kilometre while the North West had the lowest. Trend assessment showed that emissions from trucks increased rapidly while emissions from other modes of transport decreased over the study period.},

abstract = {Objectives. To quantify the mortality burden attributed to urban outdoor air pollution in South Africa in 2000. Design. The study followed comparative risk assessment (CRA) methodology developed by the World Heath Organization (WHO). In most urban areas, annual mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with diameters less than 10 {\&}{\#}956;m (PM10) from monitoring network data and PM with diameters less than 2.5 {\&}{\#}956;m (PM2.5) derived using a ratio method were weighted according to population size. PM10 and PM2.5 data from air-quality assessment studies in areas not covered by the network were also included. Population-attributable fractions calculated using risk coefficients presented in the WHO study were weighted by the proportion of the total population (33{\%}) in urban environments, and applied to revised estimates of deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) for South Africa in 2000. Setting. South Africa. Subjects. Children under 5 years and adults 30 years and older. Outcome measures. Mortality and YLLs from lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease in adults (30 years and older), and from acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in children aged 0 - 4 years. Results. Outdoor air pollution in urban areas in South Africa was estimated to cause 3.7{\%} of the national mortality from cardiopulmonary disease and 5.1{\%} of mortality attributable to cancers of the trachea, bronchus and lung in adults aged 30 years and older, and 1.1{\%} of mortality from ARIs in children under 5 years of age. This amounts to 4 637 or 0.9{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval 0.3 - 1.5{\%}) of all deaths and about 42 000 YLLs, or 0.4{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval 0.1 - 0.7{\%}) of all YLLs in persons in South Africa in 2000. Conclusion. Urban air pollution has under-recognised public health impacts in South Africa. Fossil fuel combustion emissions and traffic-related air pollution remain key targets for public health in South Africa. South African Medical Journal Vol. 97 (8) Part 2 2007: pp. 782-790},

Distinct variations of CCN activation with particle chemical composition were observed but played a secondary role. When the temporal variation of chemical effects on CCN activation is neglected, variation in the size distribution alone explains 84 to 96{\%} of the variation in CCN concentrations. Understanding that particles' ability to act as CCN is largely controlled by aerosol size rather than composition greatly facilitates the treatment of aerosol effects on cloud physics in regional and global models.},

abstract = {The situation investigated is sound propagation from a monopole point source located over an impedance surface. The sound propagation is assumed to be influenced by wind and temperature gradients. A very accurate calculation method for taking into account the effect of wind and temperature gradients on sound propagation outdoors is presented and used for verification of a new approximate calculation model. This comparison shows that the approximate model is accurate. A series of loudspeaker measurements has been carried out over a grass-covered ground for distances up to 80 m. The measurements were carried out for a wind speed fo 2–2{\textperiodcentered}5 m/s measured 10 m above the ground. The measured data agree very well with the calculated results. Furthermore the results from the approximate calculation model agree with results from previous investigations [1,2]. Hence, the main conclusion is that a simple and powerful approximate model for sound propagation under the influence of wind and temperature gradients has been developed. However, the influence of turbulence is not taken into account in this paper, and the wind and temperature gradients are assumed to be constant as functions of height.},

@article{Habib2009,
abstract = {Summary This study presents a validation analysis of a radar-based multisensor precipitation estimation product (MPE) focusing on small temporal and spatial scales that are of hydrological importance. The 44km2 hourly MPE estimates are produced at the National Weather Service (NWS) regional River Forecast Centers and mosaicked as a national product known as Stage IV. The validation analysis was conducted during a 3-year period (2004-2006) using a high quality experimental rain gauge network in south Louisiana, United States, that was not included in the development of the MPE product. The dense arrangement of rain gauges within two MPE 44km2 pixels provided a reasonably accurate approximation of area-average surface rainfall and avoided limitations of near-point gauge observations that are typically encountered in validation of radar-rainfall products. The overall bias between MPE and surface rainfall is rather small when evaluated over an annual basis; however, on an event-scale basis, the bias reaches up to 25{\%} of the event total rainfall depth during for half of the events and exceeds 50{\%} for 10{\%} of the events. Negative bias (underestimation) is more dominant (65{\%} of events), which is likely caused by range-related effects such as beam overshooting and spreading over the study site ({\~{}}120km from the closest radar site). A clear conditional bias was observed as the MPE estimates tend to overestimate small rain rates (conditional bias of 60-90{\%} for rates lower than 0.5mm/h) and underestimate large rain rates (up to -20{\%} for rates higher than 10mm/h). False detections and lack of detection problems contributed to the MPE bias, but were negligible enough to not result in significant false detection or underestimation of rainfall volumes. A significant scatter was observed between MPE and surface rainfall, especially at small intensities where the standard deviation of differences was in the order of 200-400{\%} and the correlation coefficient was rather poor. However, the same statistics showed a much better agreement at medium to high rainfall rates. The MPE product was also successful in reproducing the underlying spatial and temporal organization of surface rainfall as reflected in the assessment of rainfall self-correlations and the extreme tail of the hourly rainfall marginal distribution. The quantitative results of this analysis emphasized the need for multiple gauges within MPE pixels as a prerequisite for validation studies. Using a single gauge within an MPE pixel as a reference representation of surface rainfall resulted in an unrealistic inflation of the actual MPE estimation error by 120-180{\%}, especially during high-variability rainfall cases. This and the enhanced quality of the reference gauge dataset, explain the improved performance by MPE as compared to other previous studies. Compared to previous studies, the current analysis shows a significant improvement in the MPE performance. This is attributed to two main factors: continuous MPE algorithmic improvements and increased experience by its users at the NWS forecast centers, and the use of high-quality and dense rain gauge observations as a validation reference dataset. The later factor ensured that gauge-related errors are not wrongly assigned to radar estimation uncertainties.},

sources on exercise-induced ischemia. We collected daily outdoor
PM2.5 samples between autumn 1998 and spring 1999 in Helsinki, Finland.
The mass of PM2.5 was apportioned between five sources. Forty-five
elderly nonsmoking persons with stable coronary heart disease visited
a clinic biweekly for submaximal exercise testing, during which the
occurrence of ST segment depressions was recorded. Levels of PM2.5
originating from local traffic and long-range transport were associated
with ST segment depressions {\textgreater} 0.1 mV, with odds ratios at 2-day lag
of 1.53 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.19–1.97] and 1.11 (95{\%}
CI, 1.02–1.20) per 1 $\mu$g/m3, respectively. In multipollutant models,
where we used indicator elements for sources instead of source-specific
PM2.5, only absorbance (elemental carbon), an indicator of local
traffic and other combustion, was associated with ST segment depressions.
Our results suggest that the PM fraction originating from combustion
processes, notably traffic, exacerbates ischemic heart diseases associated
with PM mass.},

abstract = {Atmospheric aerosol particles serve as condensation nuclei for the formation of both, cloud droplets and atmospheric ice particles. As a result, they exert a substantial influence on the microphysical properties of water and ice clouds, which in turn affect the processes that lead to the formation of rain, snow, hail, and other forms of precipitation. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the chemical composition of aerosols, their microphysical properties, and the factors that enable them to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN). The first part of this review article will focus on the nature and sources of CCN and IN. We discuss the fundamentals of the cloud droplet and ice nucleation processes, and the role that the chemical composition and particle size play in this process. We show that, in many instances, the influence of chemical composition can be represented by a simple parameterization, which leaves particle size as the main variable controlling CCN efficiency. Aerosol particles are produced either directly by anthropogenic and natural sources (dust, sea salt, soot, biological particles, etc.), or they are formed in the atmosphere by condensation of low-volatility compounds (e.g., sulfuric acid or oxidized organic compounds). We discuss the magnitude of these sources, and the CCN and IN characteristics of the particles they produce. In contrast to previous assessments, which focused on the aerosol mass, we are emphasizing the number of particles being produced, as this is the key variable in cloud microphysics. Large uncertainties still exist for many aerosol sources, e.g., the submicron part of the seaspray aerosol, the particles produced by the biosphere, and the secondary organic aerosol. We conclude with a discussion on what particle concentrations may have been in the pristine atmosphere, before the onset on anthropogenic pollution. Model calculations and observations in remote continental regions consistently suggest that CCN concentrations over the pristine continents were similar to those now prevailing over the remote oceans, suggesting that human activities have modified cloud microphysics more than what is reflected in conventional wisdom. The second part of this review will address the effects of changing CCN and IN abundances on precipitation processes, the water cycle, and climate. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Radiative transfer calculations are based on airborne aerosol and cloud measurements made on 7 September 2000, being representative for the aerosol optical properties and the relative location of aerosol and clouds during Southern African Fire-Atmosphere Research Initiative (SAFARI) 2000. We focus on how the radiative effects of biomass aerosol are changed in the presence of clouds to the west of the southern African coastline. The typical scenario observed showed a clear separation between an elevated biomass aerosol layer (1.8–3.7 km altitude) and low-level stratiform clouds (below 1 km, liquid water path 85 g m−2). The aerosol was characterized by particle concentrations of 1800 cm−3 and a single scattering albedo at 550 nm wavelength of around 0.90. Presuming no effect by the biomass aerosol on the clouds themselves, the presence of clouds converted the negative TOA forcing by the biomass aerosol in clear skies into a positive one (−13.0 W m−2 converted to +11.5 W m−2 for average optical properties of the biomass aerosol and a solar zenith angle of 60°). As biomass aerosol was found above cloud thousands of kilometers away from the southern African coastline, positive direct TOA forcings can be expected in extended sea areas over the Namibian cloud sheet. These results suggest errors in global climate model (GCM) modeling assessments of the direct radiative forcing due to biomass aerosols. Additionally, we estimate the possibility that a potential indirect effect dominates the overall forcing, resulting generally in strong negative TOA forcings.},

The model was able to closely predict the crop yield variability measured within the field when the measured soil type and plant population were used as model inputs. Remote sensing was useful in finding spatial patterns across the field to target sampling and to provide spatial inputs for the model.

@article{Inglesi2010,
abstract = {In 2008, South Africa experienced a severe electricity crisis. Domestic and industrial electricity users had to suffer from black outs all over the country. It is argued that partially the reason was the lack of research on energy, locally. However, Eskom argues that the lack of capacity can only be solved by building new power plants. The objective of this study is to specify the variables that explain the electricity demand in South Africa and to forecast electricity demand by creating a model using the Engle-Granger methodology for co-integration and Error Correction models. By producing reliable results, this study will make a significant contribution that will improve the status quo of energy research in South Africa. The findings indicate that there is a long run relationship between electricity consumption and price as well as economic growth/income. The last few years in South Africa, price elasticity was rarely taken into account because of the low and decreasing prices in the past. The short-run dynamics of the system are affected by population growth, too. After the energy crisis, Eskom, the national electricity supplier, is in search for substantial funding in order to build new power plants that will help with the envisaged lack of capacity that the company experienced. By using two scenarios for the future of growth, this study shows that the electricity demand will drop substantially due to the price policies agreed - until now - by Eskom and the National Energy Regulator South Africa (NERSA) that will affect the demand for some years. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Measurements of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) made over the North Pacific Ocean in July 2002 are analysed with concurrent measurements of aerosol number, mass and composition. Overall the CCN are controlled by the sulphate, including one case that suggests particle nucleation and growth resulting from dimethyl sulphide oxidation that enhanced CCN concentrations. Hourly CCN concentrations are correlated with concentrations of sulphate plus methanesulphonic acid (MSA) over the entire study period (r(2)=0.43 and 0.52 for supersaturations of 0.34{\%} and 0.19{\%}, respectively), and are not well correlated with other organics (r(2){\textless}0.2). One case study reveals elevated mass and number concentrations of ultrafine and fine organic particles due to regional ship emissions, identified through quadrupole aerosol mass spectrometer (Q-AMS) measurements, during which organic mass concentrations are correlated with CCN values (r(2)=0.39 and 0.46 for supersaturations of 0.19{\%} and 0.34{\%}, respectively). The evolution of the time series and mass distributions of organics, sulphate and MSA over this timeframe indicate that the regional distribution of small, diffuse ship-sourced organic particles act as condensation sites for sulphur species, resulting in a subsequent increase in number concentrations of CCN. We conclude that, where present, direct emissions of anthropogenic organic particles may exert a strong control on marine CCN concentrations once diffused into the marine atmosphere, by acting as condensation sites for biogenic and anthropogenic sulphur species.},

abstract = {Most wood boilers used for residential heating today are old-fashioned and emit large quantities of organic compounds. The installation of a pellet burner and a change to wood pellets as fuel normally decreases the emissions remarkably. In this study, the emissions from different equipment for burning of wood and pellets are compared. The organic fraction of smoke from traditional wood burning is to a great extent composed of methoxyphenols, with antioxidant effects. Methoxyphenols were also identified in smoke from pellet stoves. A fuelwood boiler or a furnace with an inserted pellet burner is heated to a higher combustion temperature, decreasing the total amount of organic compounds in the smoke. Above 800°C, methoxyphenols are thermally decomposed and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) are formed. The combustion-formed aromatic hydrocarbon benzene is present in smoke from all kinds of burning, but the proportion relative to primary organic compounds increases with increasing combustion temperature. In smoke from an environmentally labelled wood boiler and from some pellet burning devices, the levels of PAC and benzene were found to be low. Evidently, the combustion was nearly complete. Although the change from wood to pellets significantly decreases the emissions, considerable differences exist between various combinations of pellet burners and boiler furnaces. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract A new algorithm is applied to study water vapor fluxes in the troposphere using wind and moisture data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The fluxes are divided into filamentary structures known as tropospheric rivers and what are termed here broad fields. The results show that the tropospheric rivers may carry essentially the total meridional transport observed in the extratropical atmosphere but may occupy only about 10{\%} of the total longitudinal length at a given latitude. The transient fluxes in traditional studies do not catch the filamentary structures completely and may therefore underestimate the fraction of transport assigned to moving systems, as well as omitting the geographical concentration. The mean flow and eddy fluxes evaluated by the new algorithm are considered to be more physically realistic.},

abstract = {Many arid and semi-arid regions have sparse precipitation observing networks, which limits the capacity for detailed hydrological modelling, water resources management and flood forecasting efforts. The objective of this work is to evaluate the utility of relatively high-spatial resolution rainfall products to reproduce observed multi-decadal rainfall characteristics such as climatologies, anomalies and trends over Saudi Arabia. Our study compares the statistical characteristics of rainfall from 53 observatories over the reference period 1965–2005, with rainfall data from six widely used gauge-based products, including APHRODITE, GPCC, PRINCETON, UDEL, CRU and PREC/L. In addition, the performance of three global climate models (GCMs), including CCSM4, EC-EARTH and MRI-I-CGCM3, integrated as part of the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), was also evaluated. Results indicate that the gauge-based products were generally skillful in reproducing rainfall characteristics in Saudi Arabia. In most cases, the gauge-based products were also able to capture the annual cycle, anomalies and climatologies of observed data, although significant inter-product variability was observed, depending on the assessment metric being used. In comparison, the GCM-based products generally exhibited poor performance, with larger biases and very weak correlations, particularly during the summertime. Importantly, all products generally failed to reproduce the observed long-term seasonal and annual trends in the region, particularly during the dry seasons (summer and autumn). Overall, this work suggests that selected gauge-based products with daily (APHRODITE and PRINCETON) and monthly (GPCC and CRU) resolutions show superior performance relative to other products, implying that they may be the most appropriate data source from which multi-decadal variations of rainfall can be investigated at the regional scale over Saudi Arabia. Discriminating these skillful products is important not only for reducing uncertainty in climate, hydrological and environmental assessments but also for advancing model developments in the region.},

It provides an integrated view of cli- mate change as the final part of the IPCCs Fourth Assessment Re- port (AR4). Topic 1 summarises observed changes in climate and their ef- fects on natural and human systems, regardless of their causes, while Topic 2 assesses the causes of the observed changes. Topic 3 pre- sents projections of future climate change and related impacts un- der different scenarios. Topic 4 discusses adaptation and mitigation options over the next few decades and their interactions with sustainable develop- ment. Topic 5 assesses the relationship between adaptation and mitigation on a more conceptual basis and takes a longer-term per- spective. Topic 6 summarises the major robust findings and remain- ing key uncertainties in this assessment. A schematic framework representing anthropogenic drivers, impacts of and responses to climate change, and their linkages, is shown in Figure I.1. At the time of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001, information was mainly available to describe the linkages clockwise, i.e. to derive climatic changes and impacts from socio-economic information and emissions. With increased under- standing of these linkages, it is now possible to assess the linkages also counterclockwise, i.e. to evaluate possible development path- ways and global emissions constraints that would reduce the risk of future impacts that society may wish to avoid.},

Based on composition, morphology, and microstructure, three distinct types of carbonaceous particles were present in the smoke: organic particles with inorganic K- salt) inclusions, tar ball'' particles, and soot. The relative number concentrations of organic particles were largest in young smoke, whereas tar balls were dominant in a slightly aged similar to 1 hour) smoke from a smoldering fire. Flaming fires emitted relatively more soot particles than smoldering fires, but soot was a minor constituent of all studied plumes. Further aging caused the accumulation of sulfate on organic and soot particles, as indicated by the large number of internally mixed organic/ sulfate and soot/ sulfate particles in the regional haze. Externally mixed ammonium sulfate particles dominated in the boundary layer hazes, whereas organic/ sulfate particles were the most abundant type in the upper hazes. Apparently, elevated haze layers were more strongly affected by biomass smoke than those within the boundary layer. Based on size distributions and the observed patterns of internal mixing, we hypothesize that organic and soot particles are the cloud-nucleating constituents of biomass smoke aerosols. Sea- salt particles dominated in the samples taken in stratus clouds over the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Namibia, whereas a distinct haze layer above the clouds consisted of aged biomass smoke particles.},

abstract = {Abstract The characteristics of radar echoes for 12 thunderstorm days in the vicinity of Sydney, Australia, in the summer of 1995/96 have been examined using an objective methodology for storm identification and tracking. The spatial distribution of identified storms shows a maximum in frequency and intensity along the east side of the mountains that lie inland from the coast. Characteristics such as storm volume, area, and height are shown to have a lognormal frequency distribution. Reflectivity also has a skewed frequency distribution with a prevalence of lower reflectivity storms. Both the maximum reflectivity and storm height are shown to be correlated with the logarithm of storm volume. Although small storms predominate, the bulk of precipitation flux comes from the relatively few large-scale storms. It is also shown that storms generally move or propagate in a direction slightly to the left of the mass-weighted mean wind for the surface-to-300-hPa layer at a speed slightly less than the mean speed. ...},

Normally, the LAWR system operates with the Dimensionless Radar Output (DRO) instead of dBZ, because the absolute scaling to dBZ is unknown for the LAWR. A transformation methodology is proposed for LAWR DRO–dBZ conversion. The method applies dBZ observations from ground based disdrometers. The paper illustrates the possibility of establishing a direct relationship between the LAWR DRO estimates and the physical radar reflectivity of the precipitation. Also, rain intensity estimate from the LAWR system, by means of the Marshall–Palmer relation, is conducted nonlinearly from the DRO estimate. This diverges from prior investigations and applications of the LAWR system, which typically rely on a linear assumption between the rain intensity and the LAWR DRO.},

A longitudinally distributed, radially lumped capacitance model provided for the convective heat transfer to the wire and the transient heat conduction along it. Similarly, the temperature gradient across the thin dimension of the mica support was neglected, and a radially distributed model provided for the convective heat transfer to the mica and the transient conduction within it. The two solutions are coupled by the boundary conditions at the wire-mica contact.

abstract = {The ability of advanced state-of-the-art methods of downscaling large-scale climate predictions to regional and local scale as seasonal rainfall forecasting tools for South Africa is assessed. Various downscaling techniques and raw general circulation model {\{}(GCM){\}} output are compared to one another over 10 {\{}December-January-February{\}} {\{}(DJF){\}} seasons from 1991/1992 to 2000/2001 and also to a baseline prediction technique that uses only global sea-surface temperature {\{}(SST){\}} anomalies as predictors. The various downscaling techniques described in this study include both an empirical technique called model output statistics {\{}(MOS){\}} and a dynamical technique where a finer resolution regional climate model {\{}(RCM){\}} is nested into the large-scale fields of a coarser {\{}GCM.{\}} The study addresses the performance of a number of simulation systems (no forecast lead-time) of varying complexity. These systems' performance is tested for both homogeneous regions and for 963 stations over South Africa, and compared with each other over the 10-year test period. For the most part, the simulations method outscores the baseline method that uses {\{}SST{\}} anomalies to simulate rainfall, therefore providing evidence that current approaches in seasonal forecasting are outscoring earlier ones. Current operational forecasting approaches involve the use of {\{}GCMs,{\}} which are considered to be the main tool whereby seasonal forecasting efforts will improve in the future. Advantages in statistically post-processing output from {\{}GCMs{\}} as well as output from {\{}RCMs{\}} are demonstrated.

abstract = {This study investigates changes in the frequency and timing of tropical cyclone landfalls over the south-west Indian Ocean during the last 66years. Little is known about the spatial and temporal trends of such storm landfalls during recent historical times, specifically the last ca. 100years. By analysing three storm track records spanning periods of 66-161years, we establish that much of the perceived change in storm numbers can be attributed to improvements in storm detection methods over the past century. Furthermore, we find no statistically significant trends in the frequency of tropical cyclone landfalls over Madagascar and Mozambique over the past 6 decades, despite more comprehensive records during the most recent period. There is, however, considerable interannual variability in the number of storms making landfall over the countries investigated; most probably driven by cyclical atmospheric forcing, including El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO). Recent trends indicate an increasing number of tropical cyclones tracking to the south of Madagascar, potentially associated with the southward shift of the 26 degrees C isotherm, combined with a decrease in the steering flow during La Nina years.},

abstract = {A novel remote sensing approach to simultaneously retrieve cloud liquid
water paths (LWP) and ice water paths (IWP) and mean rainfall rate
in a vertical atmospheric column was applied for stratiform-like
precipitation events observed during the warm period of 2007 at the
southern Great Plains site of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement
(ARM) Program. The retrieval method is based on multifrequency radar
measurements at W, Ka, and S bands and raindrop size distribution
estimates from a ground-based impact disdrometer. The radar measurements
also provide a robust separation of the liquid, mixed, and ice hydrometeor
layers. Characteristic values of LWP are about 300ug m-3, although
values up to 1000 g m-3 and higher are not uncommon. There is on
average insignificant correlation between cloud LWP and rainfall
rates. IWP, which represents the precipitating cloud part of the
atmospheric column that is observed above the freezing level, usually
significantly exceeds cloud LWP in the liquid hydrometeor layer and
can reach values of approximately 104 g m-3 and even higher. On average,
mean rainfall in the liquid layer, Rm, increases with an increase
in ice mass observed above the melting layer, although a corresponding
mean correlation coefficient between Rm and IWP is only 0.32. There
is noticeable variability in IWP-Rm relations between individual
events. Storm dynamics is likely to influence the correlation between
cloud and rainfall parameters as inferred from simultaneous columnar
retrievals. Initial estimates indicate that IWP and rainfall are
stronger related for events which exhibit lower vertical variability
of wind.},

abstract = {Local in its causes and global in its impacts, climate change still poses an unresolved challenge for scientists, politicians, entrepreneurs, and citizens. Climate change research is largely global in focus, aims at enhanced understanding, and is driven by experts, all of which seem to be insufficient to anchor climate change action in regional and local contexts. We present results from a participatory scenario study conducted in collaboration with the municipality of Delta in SW British Columbia, Canada. This study applies a participatory capacity building approach for climate change action at the local level where the sources of emissions and the mechanisms of adaptation reside and where climate change is meaningful to decision-makers and stakeholders alike. The multi-scale scenario approach consists of synthesizing global climate change scenarios, downscaling them to the regional and local level, and finally visualizing alternative climate scenarios out to 2100 in 3D views of familiar, local places. We critically discuss the scenarios produced and the strengths and weaknesses of the approach applied. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The conversion of the radar reflectivity factor Z (mm(6)m(-3)) to rain rate R (mm h(-1)) is a crucial step in the hydrological application of weather radar measurements. It has been common practice for over 50 years now to take for this conversion a simple power law relationship between Z and R. It is the purpose of this paper to explain that the fundamental reason for the existence of such power law relationships is the fact that Z and R are related to each other via the raindrop size distribution. To this end, the concept of the raindrop size distribution is first explained. Then, it is demonstrated that there exist two fundamentally different forms of the raindrop size distribution, one corresponding to raindrops present in a volume of air and another corresponding to those arriving at a surface. It is explained how Z and R are defined in terms of both these forms. Using the classical exponential raindrop size distribution as an example, it is demonstrated (1) that the definitions of Z and R naturally lead to power law Z-R relationships, and (2) how the coefficients of such relationships are related to the parameters of the raindrop size distribution. Numerous empirical Z-R relationships are analysed to demonstrate that there exist systematic differences in the coefficients of these relationships and the corresponding parameters of the (exponential) raindrop size distribution between different types of rainfall. Finally, six consistent Z-R relationships are derived. based upon different assumptions regarding the rain rate dependence of the parameters of the (exponential) raindrop size distribution. An appendix shows that these relationships are in fact special cases of a general Z-R relationship that follows from a recently proposed scaling framework for describing raindrop size distributions and their properties.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {Global-scale models of atmospheric chemistry (GACMs) {\^{a}}{\oe}mix{\^{a}} biomass burning emissions into grid boxes with horizontal scales of 10{\^{a}}200 km. This ignores the complex nonlinear transformations that take place in the young smoke plumes. Here we use a new gas- and aerosol-phase chemistry model called Aerosol Simulation Program (ASP) and a 3-D Eulerian smoke plume model to simulate the fluid dynamics, radiative transfer, gas-phase chemistry, and aerosol-phase chemistry of the Timbavati smoke plume observed during SAFARI 2000. We then compare the results of the 3-D plume model with those of an Eulerian box model, which is used as an analog for the large grid boxes of GACMs. The 3-D plume model matched the observed plume injection height but required a large minimum horizontal diffusion coefficient to match the observed horizontal dispersion of the plume. Absorption and scattering by smoke aerosols reduced the modeled photolysis rates in the plume by 10{\^{a}}20{\%}. Increasing the heterogeneous production of HONO and H2SO4 in the model and including uncharacterized organic species using monoterpenes as a proxy compound improves the model-observation match. Direct measurements of OH in the smoke plumes would be an excellent way to determine if heterogeneous production of HONO is taking place. The automatic dilution of smoke plume emissions into the large grid boxes of global models can result in large errors in predicted concentrations of O3, NO x and aerosol species downwind. We discuss several potential approaches that could reduce these errors.},

abstract = {Abstract A fuzzy logic and neuro-fuzzy system for classification of hydrometeor type based on polarimetric radar measurements is described in this paper. The hydrometeor classification system is implemented by using fuzzy logic and a neural network, where the fuzzy logic is used to infer hydrometeor type, and the neural network learning algorithm is used for automatic adjustment of the parameters of the fuzzy sets in the fuzzy logic system according to prior knowledge. Five radar measurements, namely, horizontal reflectivity (ZH), differential reflectivity (ZDR), differential propagation phase shift (KDP), correlation coefficient [$\rho$HV(0)], and linear depolarization ratio (LDR), and corresponding altitude, have been used as input variables to the neuro-fuzzy network. The output of the neuro-fuzzy system is one of the many possible hydrometeor types: 1) drizzle, 2) rain, 3) dry and low density snow, 4) dry and high-density crystals, 5) wet and melting snow, 6) dry graupel, 7) wet graupel, 8) small hail, 9) ...},

abstract = {High pollution levels have been often observed in urban street canyons due to the increased traffic emissions and reduced natural ventilation. Microscale dispersion models with different levels of complexity may be used to assess urban air quality and support decision-making for pollution control strategies and traffic planning. Mathematical models calculate pollutant concentrations by solving either analytically a simplified set of parametric equations or numerically a set of differential equations that describe in detail wind flow and pollutant dispersion. Street canyon models, which might also include simplified photochemistry and particle deposition–resuspension algorithms, are often nested within larger-scale urban dispersion codes. Reduced-scale physical models in wind tunnels may also be used for investigating atmospheric processes within urban canyons and validating mathematical models. A range of monitoring techniques is used to measure pollutant concentrations in urban streets. Point measurement methods (continuous monitoring, passive and active pre-concentration sampling, grab sampling) are available for gaseous pollutants. A number of sampling techniques (mainly based on filtration and impaction) can be used to obtain mass concentration, size distribution and chemical composition of particles. A combination of different sampling/monitoring techniques is often adopted in experimental studies. Relatively simple mathematical models have usually been used in association with field measurements to obtain and interpret time series of pollutant concentrations at a limited number of receptor locations in street canyons. On the other hand, advanced numerical codes have often been applied in combination with wind tunnel and/or field data to simulate small-scale dispersion within the urban canopy.},

abstract = {Sun photometers that use light-emitting diode (LED) detectors in place of optical interference filters and photo diodes have significant potential advantages, including low cost, durability, and long-term optical stability. However, their relatively wide spectral response bandwidth poses some challenges in calibration and interpretation. Analysis of LED-based Sun photometers developed for the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program has demonstrated that such instruments can, in fact, be calibrated using the standard Langley plot method and that their performance can be described in terms of effective response wavelengths. Several GLOBE Sun photometers have been calibrated at Mauna Loa Observatory on two separate occasions. The derived extraterrestrial constants are essentially the same in spite of the fact that the calibrations were performed under significantly different atmospheric conditions. These reference instruments have been used to transfer calibrations to other optically and electronically identical Sun photometers, thereby making it possible to establish a large network of inexpensive LED-based Sun photometers. Data collected by students at a GLOBE high school near NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and compared against aerosol optical thickness measurements from Sun photometers at GSFC demonstrate both that students can reliably make the required measurements and that LED-based Sun photometers give results that compare favorably with conventional filter-based instruments, even though their optical properties are significantly different.

abstract = {The deposition of sulfur dioxide on growing vegetation is affected by diverse environmental factors, many of which undergo large diurnal and spatial variations. The aerodynamic resistance to vertical transfer in the surface boundary layer can be formulated in terms of the friction velocity, height of observation, vertical heat flux, and surface roughness. Also important are the resistance in the air layer closest to the surface elements and, in dry vegetation, the average stomatal resistance of the plants. The latter variable is among the most difficult to estimate, but over many agricultural field crops like those in the midwestern U.S., a typical minimum value of average stomatal resistance to SO2 transfer is about 0.7 s cm-1, as is indicated by various experimental data. The deposition velocity can be estimated as the inverse of the sum of the resistances of the layers, necessarily down to where the concentrations are zero; in the surface boundary layer, any of the various resistances might be dominant...},

The authors focus on 11 mountain$\backslash$nwatersheds in the Colorado Front Range for two warm-season convective$\backslash$nperiods in 2004 and 2006.

The authors postulate$\backslash$nthat rainfall and watershed characteristics are responsible for patterns$\backslash$nthat determine flood predictability at different catchment scales.$\backslash$nCoupled simulations reveal that the largest decrease in precipitation$\backslash$nforecast skill occurs between 15- and 45-min lead times that coincide$\backslash$nwith rapid development and movements of convective systems. Consistent$\backslash$nwith this, flood forecasting skill decreases with nowcasting lead time,$\backslash$nbut the functional relation depends on the interactions between$\backslash$nwatershed properties and rainfall characteristics.

abstract = {As part of the Southern Africa Fire-Atmosphere Research Initiative (SAFARI-92), size-fractionated aerosol samples were collected during September-October 1992 at three fixed ground-based sites in the eastern Transvaal, i.e., at two sites within the Kruger National Park (KNP) and at a third site on the Transvaal highveld (about 150 km WSW of the KNP sites), and near a number of prescribed fires in the KNP. The collection devices consisted of stacked filter units, which separate the aerosol into a coarse (2-10 mu m equivalent aerodynamic diameter (EAD)) and a fine ({\textless}2 mu m EAD) size fraction, and of eight-stage cascade impactors, which provide more detailed size fractionation. The samples were analyzed for particulate mass (PM), black carbon (BC), and up to 47 elements. The prescribed fires gave rise to high levels of airborne soil dust, but several species (elements) were particularly enriched in the pyrogenic emissions. This was the case for BC, P, K, Ca, Mn, Zn, Sr, and I in the coarse fraction, and for BC, the halogens (Cl, Br, I), K, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sb, Cs, and Pb (and in the flaming phase also Na and S) in the fine fraction. The aerosol concentrations, compositions, and time trends at the two KNP sites were quite similar, suggesting that regionally representative samples were collected. Receptor modeling calculations, using both absolute principal component analysis and chemical mass balance, indicated that the KNP coarse PM was essentially attributable to mineral dust and sea salt, with average relative apportionments of 75{\%} and 25{\%}, respectively. At the highveld site, mineral dust and sea salt contributed in a 99-to-1 ratio to the coarse PM. In the fine size fraction at all three fixed sites, four components were identified, i.e., mineral dust, sea salt, biomass burning products, and sulfate. The pyrogenic component was the dominant contributor to the atmospheric concentrations of BC, K, Zn, and I, a major source for PM, Cl, Cu, Br, and Cs, but only a minor source for S. About 40{\%} of the fine PM was, on the average, attributed to the pyrogenic particles, and about one third of it to the sulfate component. Relation of the time trends of the various components with three-dimensional air mass back trajectories indicated that elevated levels of pyrogenic products were mostly found in air masses arriving from the north. The levels of he sulfate component tended to be higher at the highveld site than at the two KNP sites, and this component was generally associated with continental air. It was concluded that the major contribution to this fine sulfate came from fossil fuel burning and various industrial activities on the Transvaal highveld.},

The fluxes are divided into filamentary structures known as tropospheric rivers and what are termed here broad fields. The results show that the tropospheric rivers may carry essentially the total meridional transport observed in the extratropical atmosphere but may occupy only about 10{\%} of the total longitudinal length at a given latitude. The transient fluxes in traditional studies do not catch the filamentary structures completely and may therefore underestimate the fraction of transport assigned to moving systems, as well as omitting the geographical concentration. The mean flow and eddy fluxes evaluated by the new algorithm are considered to be more physically realistic.},

abstract = {Individual aerosol particles collected over southern Africa during the SAFARI 2000 field study were studied using transmission electron microscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. The sizes, shapes, compositions, mixing states, surface coatings, and relative abundances of aerosol particles from biomass burning, in boundary layer hazes, and in the free troposphere were compared, with emphasis on aging and reactions of inorganic smoke particles. Potassium salts and organic particles were the predominant species in the smoke, and most were internally mixed. More KCl particles occur in young smoke, whereas more K2SO4 and KNO3 particles were present in aged smoke. This change indicates that with the aging of the smoke, KCl particles from the fires were converted to K2SO4 and KNO3 through reactions with sulfur- and nitrogen- bearing species from biomass burning as well as other sources. More soot was present in smoke from flaming grass fires than bush and wood fires, probably due to the predominance of flaming combustion in grass fires. The high abundance of organic particles and soluble salts can affect the hygroscopic properties of biomass-burning aerosols and therefore influence their role as cloud condensation nuclei. Particles from biomass burning were important constituents of the regional hazes.},

The transport fields are then combined to show both horizontal and vertical transport of air to and from Pretoria at the different levels. Air transport patterns in the vertical are linked to the occurrence of absolutely stable layers which are also evident in the 16 ozonesonde profiles recorded at Pretoria during SAFARI. The coherence of the stratification based on dynamical and ozone analysis permits the use of mean ozone profiles with air volume fluxes to interpret the ozone in terms of photochemistry and transport within stable layers. Extensive recirculation across the meridional plane at Pretoria implies that advection of ozone is slow and that photochemistry is responsible for the observed vertical structure over central southern Africa in September and October 1992. Requisite ozone formation rates are supported by model analysis of ozone and ozone precursors measured from SAFARI and Transport and Atmospheric Research Chemistry near the Equator-Atlantic aircraft.},

@article{cariolle_2009,
abstract = {A method is presented to parameterize the impact of the nonlinear
chemical reactions occurring in the plume generated by concentrated
NOx sources into large-scale models. The resulting plume parameterization
is implemented into global models and used to evaluate the impact
of aircraft emissions on the atmospheric chemistry. Compared to previous
approaches that rely on corrected emissions or corrective factors
to account for the nonlinear chemical effects, the present parameterization
is based on the representation of the plume effects via a fuel tracer
and a characteristic lifetime during which the nonlinear interactions
between species are important and operate via rates of conversion
for the NOx species and an effective reaction rates for O3. The implementation
of this parameterization insures mass conservation and allows the
transport of emissions at high concentrations in plume form by the
model dynamics. Results from the model simulations of the impact
on atmospheric ozone of aircraft NOx emissions are in rather good
agreement with previous work. It is found that ozone production is
decreased by 10 to 25{\%} in the Northern Hemisphere with the largest
effects in the north Atlantic flight corridor when the plume effects
on the global-scale chemistry are taken into account. These figures
are consistent with evaluations made with corrected emissions, but
regional differences are noticeable owing to the possibility offered
by this parameterization to transport emitted species in plume form
prior to their dilution at large scale. This method could be further
improved to make the parameters used by the parameterization function
of the local temperature, humidity and turbulence properties diagnosed
by the large-scale model. Further extensions of the method can also
be considered to account for multistep dilution regimes during the
plume dissipation. Furthermore, the present parameterization can
be adapted to other types of point-source NOx emissions that have
to be introduced in large-scale models, such as ship exhausts, provided
that the plume life cycle, the type of emissions, and the major reactions
involved in the nonlinear chemical systems can be determined with
sufficient accuracy.},

abstract = {The AERMOD dispersion model was used to compute ambient air concentrations
of SO2 for 1-, 3-, and 24-h averaging periods using the emission
inventory data for Lucas County, Ohio for the year 1990. The estimated
concentrations were classified based on the stability parameter,
Monin{\^{a}}Obukhov length (L), for the two monitoring stations located
in the area. The data were divided into two atmospheric stability
classes (stable and convective cases) as used in the AERMOD model.
These categories were further grouped into five subcategories based
on the value of L to learn about fine details of model performance.
The model evaluation was done using several statistical parameters
used in air quality studies.AERMOD did not yield a satisfactory performance
in predicting 1- and 3-h average concentrations for the multisource
region but showed a slightly better performance in predicting the
24-h concentrations using urban option for the land use parameters.
The model had a tendency to underpredict in both the stable and convective
cases. In the 24-h averaging period factor of two (Fa2) values suggested
a better performance than fractional bias (FB). The model seemed
to perform better for the Main Street station than the Collins Park
station. Limited analysis using different land use parameters reported
in the paper indicates that model performance may improve for certain
cases. Other errors include the unavoidable scatter arising from
differences between wind direction and actual transport for an averaging
period, formulation of the model, and the emission inventory. The
results of the study should be used cautiously because of the limited
scope of the evaluation. Future work should focus on the role of
land use parameters in predicting concentrations at the monitors
and finding ways to quantify errors attributed to other factors.
However, it is clear that more guidance is needed to apply the AERMOD
model for multisource regions. Alternative schemes to divide the
data should also be considered for analyzing model performance. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright}

The Australian Bureau of Meteorology's severe weather database is extended with a detailed compilation of scientific and newspaper accounts of hail fall for the greater Sydney area for the period 1805 to 1998. Owing to its high exposure to thunderstorm and hail by virtue of population and building density, the greater Sydney area is the focus of the database. Comparisons are drawn between Sydney and the rest of NSW, and between coastal and inland areas of the state. Over the study period, a total of 1570 thunderstorms produced hail. On average, 10 hailstorms per year were recorded in Sydney in the last 50 years. However, there is a statistically significant decrease in the hailstorm frequency during the last 14 years compared with the preceding 36 years. The magnitude of hailstorms, as measured by reports of estimated hailstone size, revealed an average maximum hailstone size per storm that ranged from 3.8 to 4.0 cm for different regions. Hailstorms occur most frequently between October and February (Australian spring and summer) in NSW, with peak activity in November and December. The hail season in Sydney begins 2 months earlier (August to February). However, during the last 14 years there has been a shift to November to March. The majority of NSW hailstorms occur during the late afternoon between 3pm and 7pm, with hailstorms in Sydney occurring about 1 h earlier. The most active hail fall regions are located in the Bureau of Meteorology's northern NSW weather forecast districts of the Northern Tablelands, Northern Rivers and parts of the Northwest Slopes.

abstract = {Abstract A diaphragm pump used to boost the intake pressure of a three-stage high-pressure air compressor for collecting large air samples during aircraft flights has been developed. The pump consists of a large (17 L) spherical body divided into two chambers by means of a thin neoprene diaphragm. The pressure drop generated across an air intake and air exhaust mounted outside the aircraft drives sample air into this spherical body while the diaphragm is displaced completely to align the inside of the pump body. The air thus collected is subsequently forced into the inlet of a high-pressure compressor by letting aircraft cabin air fill the pump body from the other side of the diaphragm. The pumping cycle is controlled by the position of the diaphragm and is self-sustaining. The pressure at the intake of the high-pressure compressor is thus maintained close to that of the cabin pressure, which results in a three- to fourfold pressure boost. In this way the pumping speed of the high-pressure compressor is e...},

@article{Bertschi2003,
abstract = {1 Domestic biomass fuels (biofuels) were recently estimated to be the second largest source of carbon emissions from global biomass burning. Wood and charcoal provide approximately 90{\%} and 10{\%} of domestic energy in tropical Africa. In September 2000, we used open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopy to quantify 18 of the most abundant trace gases emitted by wood and charcoal cooking fires and an earthen charcoal-making kiln in Zambia. These are the first in situ measurements of an extensive suite of trace gases emitted by tropical biofuel burning. We report emission ratios (ER) and emission factors (EF) for (in order of abundance) carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), acetic acid (CH3COOH), methanol (CH3OH), formaldehyde (HCHO), ethene (C2H4), ammonia (NH3), acetylene (C2H2), nitric oxide (NO), ethane (C2H6), phenol (C6H5OH), propene (C3H6), formic acid (HCOOH), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), hydroxyacetaldehyde (HOCH2CHO), and furan (C4H4O). Compared to previous work, our emissions of organic acids and NH3 are 3-6.5 times larger. Another significant finding is that reactive oxygenated organic compounds account for 70-80{\%} of the total nonmethane organic compounds (NMOC). For most compounds, the combined emissions from charcoal production and charcoal burning are larger than the emissions from wood fires by factors of 3-10 per unit mass of fuel burned and similar to2 per unit energy released. We estimate that Zambian savanna fires produce more annual CO2, HCOOH, and NOx than Zambian biofuel use by factors of 2.5, 1.7, and 5, respectively. However, biofuels contribute larger annual emissions of CH4,CH3OH, C2H2,CH3COOH, HCHO, and NH3 by factors of 5.1, 3.9, 2.7, 2.4, 2.2, and 2.0, respectively. Annual CO and C2H4 emissions are approximately equal from both sources. Coupling our data with recent estimates of global biofuel consumption implies that global biomass burning emissions for several compounds are significantly larger than previously reported. Biofuel emissions are produced year-round, disperse differently than savanna fire emissions, and could strongly impact the tropical troposphere.},

abstract = {Flash floods and droughts are of major concern in Southern Africa. Hydrologists and engineers have to assist decision makers to address the issue of forecasting and monitoring extreme events. For these purposes, hydrological models are useful tools to: Identify the dominant hydrological processes which influence the water balance and result in conditions of extreme water excess and/or deficit Assist in generating both short- and long-term hydrological forecasts for use by water resource managers. In this study the physically-based and fully distributed hydrological TOPKAPI model (Liu and Todini, 2002),which has already been successfully applied in several Countries in the world (Liu and Todini, 2002; Bartholomes and Todini, 2005; Liu et al.. 2005; Martina et al., 2006), is applied in Africa for the first time. This paper contains the main theoretical and numerical components that have been integrated by the authors to model code and presents details of the application of the model in the Liebenbergsvlei catchment (4 625 km(2)) in South Africa. The physical basis of the equations, the fine-scale representation of the spatial catchment features, the parsimonious parameterisation linked to field/catchment information, the good computation time performance, the modularity of the processes. the case of use and finally the good results obtained in modelling the river discharges of Liebenbergsvlei catchment, make the TOPKAPI model a promising tool for hydrological modelling of catchments in South Africa.},

There are, however, several obstacles to the evaluation of such programs and therefore of their social, economic, environmental and energy impacts on the target population, particularly on impoverished communities located in remote areas. Evaluation of the efficacy of public policies aimed at rural electrification in South Africa, China, India and Brazil enables such actions to be quantified and re-considered so as to bolster the sustainability of their planning and implementation and also so as to enable comprehension of the significance of access to electricity in relation to other aspects of the drive to improve living standards. The provision of electric energy amounts to more than access to a public service and should be considered an essential right, in a context of social equity and justice, which permits social integration and the access to other equally essential services. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The subject of this review focuses on the main progresses made in China in the areas of cloud modeling, field observations, aerosol-cloud interactions, the effects of urbanization on cloud and precipitation, and weather modification. Well-equipped aircraft and ground-based advanced Doppler and polarized radars have been rapidly applied in cloud-seeding operations. The combined use of modern techniques such as the Global Positioning System, remote sensing, and Geographical Information Systems has greatly decreased the blindness and uncertainties in weather-modification activities. Weather-modification models based on state-of-the-art cloud-resolving models are operationally run at the National Weather Modification Centre in China for guiding weather-modification programs. Despite important progress having been made, many critical issues or challenges remain to be solved, or require stronger scientific evidence and support, such as the chain of physical events involved in the effects induced by cloud seeding. Current important progresses in measurements and seeding techniques provide the opportunity and possibility to reduce these deficiencies. Long-term scientific projects aimed at reducing these key uncertainties are extremely urgent and important for weather-modification activities in China.},

The following potential benefits to operations are identified: improvement of quantitative precipitation measurements, discrimination of hail from rain with possible determination of sizes, identification of precipitation in winter storms, identification of electrically active storms, and distinction of biological scatterers (birds vs insects). Success in rainfall measurements is attributed to unique properties of differential phase. Referrals to fields of various polarimetric variables illustrate the signatures associated with different phenomena. It is argued that classifying hydrometeors is a necessary step prior to proper quantification of the water substance. The promise of polarimetry to accomplish classification is illustrated with an application to a hailstorm.},

{\{}(QA){\}} procedures that are being applied to temperatures in the Integrated
Global Radiosonde Archive {\{}(IGRA).{\}} Because these data are routinely
used for monitoring variations in tropospheric temperature, it is
of critical importance that the system be able to detect as many
errors as possible without falsely identifying true meteorological
events as erroneous. Three steps were taken to achieve such robust
performance. First, 14 tests for excessive persistence, climatological
outliers, and vertical and temporal inconsistencies were developed
and arranged into a deliberate sequence so as to render the system
capable of detecting a variety of data errors. Second, manual review
of random samples of flagged values was used to set the “thresholds”
for each individual check so as to minimize the number of valid values
that are mistakenly identified as errors. The performance of the
system as a whole was also assessed through manual inspection of
random samples of the quality-assured data. As a result of these
efforts, the {\{}IGRA{\}} temperature {\{}QA{\}} procedures effectively remove
the grossest errors while maintaining a false-positive rate of approximately
10{\%}.},

abstract = {The coal mining region in northern Colombia is one of the largest
open pit mining regions of the world. In 2009, there were 8 mining
companies in operation with an approximate coal production of {\^{a}}¼70
Mtons/year. Since 2007, the Colombian air quality monitoring network
has reported readings that exceed the daily and annual air quality
standards for total suspended particulate (TSP) matter and particles
with an equivalent aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10{\^{A}} {\^{I}}¼m (PM10)
in nearby villages. This paper describes work carried out in order
to establish an appropriate clean air program for this region, based
on the Colombian national environmental authority requirement for
modeling of TSP and PM10 dispersion. A TSP and PM10 emission inventory
was initially developed, and topographic and meteorological information
for the region was collected and analyzed. Using this information,
the dispersion of TSP was modeled in ISC3 and AERMOD using meteorological
data collected by 3 local stations during 2008 and 2009. The results
obtained were compared to actual values measured by the air quality
monitoring network. High correlation coefficients ({\textgreater}0.73) were
obtained, indicating that the models accurately described the main
factors affecting particle dispersion in the region. The model was
then used to forecast concentrations of particulate matter for 2010.
Based on results from the model, areas within the modeling region
were identified as highly, fairly, moderately and marginally polluted
according to local regulations. Additionally, the contribution particulate
matter to the pollution at each village was estimated. Using these
predicted values, the Colombian environmental authority imposed new
decontamination measures on the mining companies operating in the
region. These measures included the relocation of three villages
financed by the mine companies based on forecasted pollution levels.},

abstract = {The use of indoor, three-stone fire pits in resource-poor countries is a substantial burden on human health and the environment. We conducted a pilot intervention promoting the purchase and use of an improved cookstove in rural Kenya. The goals of this qualitative inquiry were to understand the motivation to purchase and use; perceived benefits and challenges of cookstove use; and the most influential promotion activities for scaling up future cookstove promotion. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 10 cookstove promoters and 30 cookstove purchasers in the Luo community. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were transcribed and a thematic analysis conducted. Women reported the need for less firewood, fuel cost savings, reduced smoke, improved cooking efficiency, reduced eye irritation, lung congestion and coughing as major benefits of the cookstove. Cost appeared to be a barrier to wider adoption. The most persuasive promotion strategies were interpersonal communication through social networks and cooking demonstrations. Despite this cost barrier, many women still considered the improved cookstove to be a great asset within their household. This inquiry provided important guidance for future cookstove implementation projects.},

abstract = {Improved vegetation distribution and emission data for Africa south of the equator were developed for the Southern African Regional Science Initiative SAFARI 2000) and were combined with biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emission measurements to estimate BVOC emissions for the southern African region. The BVOCs are estimated to total 80 Tg C yr(-1) for the region, with isoprene and monoterpenes contributing 56 and 7 Tg C yr(-1), respectively. The large uncertainties, particularly in terms of basal emission capacity assignment, associated with these outputs are discussed. Woodlands are predicted to be the dominant vegetation type, covering 23{\%} of southern Africa, and are the largest annual source of isoprene 20 Tg C), monoterpenes (3 Tg C), and other VOCs (4 Tg C). Mopane savannas and woodlands are predicted to contribute over 75{\%} of all monoterpenes, primarily from light-dependent emission processes. Rain forests cover only 3.5{\%} of the total area but have high annual emission rates (9.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). In the tropical regions with high rainfall, warm temperatures, and high plant productivity throughout the year, the seasonal variation in VOC emissions was small. In subtropical regions, dominated by highly seasonal savannas and grasslands, large variations were predicted, with emissions declining by up to 85{\%} during dry winter periods (June-August) due to low leaf area index after leaf drop.},

abstract = {Abstract Potential-flow calculations of the airflow around two research aircraft are used to estimate the effect of flow distortion on measured fluxes of sensible heat and water vapor. From the calculated flow patterns, flow-distortion coefficients are determined and used to characterize biases and contamination terms in the measured fluxes. These calculations provide the basis for estimating the magnitude of the errors and in some cases for correcting the measurements. The errors in measured fluxes for typical mid-day planetary boundary layers are usually less than 5{\%}, if the normal choices for sensor locations are used, but could be much larger for other possible locations. The estimated errors for realistic measurement conditions are smaller than statistical uncertainties in the flux estimates for those same flight segments, when the flight legs are about 10 min in duration.},

A critical review of current possibilities for determining the quality of university education in Australia exposes limitations of quality assurance systems that fail to take account of student engagement. The review provides a basis for suggesting the broad relevance of student engagement to quality assurance.

Several factors influence such a relations: the drift of the hailstones in the downdrafts, the type of crop and the stage of maturity of a single crop. The damage functions were derived utilizing data from a severe hailstorm, which occurred during the hail suppression experiment Grossversuch IV in Switzerland. They permit conversion of radar measurements into estimates of expected amount and area of hail damage for nine different crops at various stages of maturity. The achieved estimates can be used for damage exceeding 20{\%}. In the future this information could be available immediately after a storm passes over a radar observation area and could help to satisfy the increasing demand for severe-weather data to judge the risk of hail damage in endangered areas. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {The Pacific Exploratory Mission-West B (PEM-West B) explored atmospheric
layer structure using measurements of O3, H2O, CO, and CH4 from the
NASA DC-8 fast-response instruments. The mission took place in February-March
1994 over the western Pacific, mainly in the northern hemisphere.
Results were compared with similar measurements made during the Pacific
Exploratory Mission-West A (PEM-West A) in September-October 1991.
PEM-West B sampled 94 vertical profiles, with an average atmospheric
depth per profile of 6.4 km, and this sampling yielded 254 discrete
layers. PEM-West A sampled 105 profiles, also with a 6.4 km average
depth, yielding 538 layers. Both missions revealed that layers containing
high ozone and low water vapor were the most abundant, and low ozone
and high water vapor layers were the next most abundant. Lidar images
and potential vorticity cross sections showed the former associated
with subsidence from the stratosphere in middle latitudes, spreading
into the tropics. The latter was associated with convection from
the boundary layer. The partition among different types of layers
only changed slightly in the two missions, although PEM-West B had
half as many layers. Compared to PEM-West A, PEM-West B showed only
one-third the number of layers associated with polluted continental
air. However, PEM-West B revealed significantly more layers showing
characteristics of descended clean marine air. In some cases these
layers originated from the southern hemisphere. For ozone- and water-vapor-rich
layers, the ozone deviation amplitude was higher in low latitudes
and lower in high latitudes in PEM-West B. The mean thickness of
layers increased from about 450 m in PEM-West A to 680 m in PEM-West
B. Layers also existed in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. CO2
measurements had sufficient vertical resolution to show layer structure
as well.},

impacts on climate. It has been well established that the urban heat
island effect is more significant during the night than day and that
it is affected by the shape, size, and geometry of buildings as well
as the differences in urban and rural gradients. Recent research
points to mounting evidence that urbanization also affects cycling
of water, carbon, aerosols, and nitrogen in the climate system. This

Samples were collected in smoke plumes of burning savanna and in regional haze. A known artifact, produced by the adsorption of organic gases on the quartz filter substrates used to collect the particulate matter samples, comprised a significant portion of the TC collected. Consequently, conclusions derived from the data are greatly dependent on whether or not OC concentrations are corrected for this artifact. For example, the estimated aerosol coalbedo (1 - single scattering albedo (SSA)), which is a measure of aerosol absorption, of the biomass smoke samples is 60{\%} larger using corrected OC concentrations. Thus, the corrected data imply that the biomass smoke is 60{\%} more absorbing than do the uncorrected data. The BC to (corrected) OC mass ratio (BC/OC) of smoke plume samples (0.18 plus or minus 0.06) is lower than that of samples collected in the regional haze (0.25 plus or minus 0.08). The difference may be due to mixing of biomass smoke with background air characterized by a higher BC/OC ratio. A simple source apportionment indicates that biomass smoke contributes about three quarters of the aerosol burden in the regional haze, while other souxes (e.g., fossil fuel burning) contribute the remainder.},

Two distinct distributions, one apparently associated with supercell tornadogenesis processes and the other with non-supercell processes, are found in both the US data and in other countries. The similarity of the distribution in the US prior to the 1950s, when an official, organized collection effort began, and the French record, suggests that only 15{\%} of French tornadoes are being reported currently. In addition, we can use the simple statistical distributions to estimate the return period of violent tornadoes in France (approximately one every 5–10 years) and the UK (approximately one every 250–300 years).},

Two years of data have been collected from two commercial center pivot irrigated fields (72 and 52 ha). Cooperating farmers manage all farming operations for crop production and provide yield maps of the maize grown on the fields. The farmers apply sufficient inputs to minimize risk of yield loss. The important variables for crop production have been sampled at a grid spacing of 76 m for two seasons. A spatial auto-regressive model was fitted to the data to determine the critical factors affecting yield variability. Thirty one layers of data were included in the analysis, and a total of over 140,000 models were examined. Up to five predictors were used in each model. Variability in water application, nitrate nitrogen, organic matter, phosphorus, topology, percent silt and soil electrical conductivity were significant in explaining the yield variability for Field 1. Variability in water application, ammonium, nematodes, percent clay, insects, potassium, soil electrical conductivity, and topology were significant in explaining the yield variability for Field 2. The tentative conclusion is that the potential economic benefit of site specific management is small where the farmer's management tolerance for risk is low. The potential of site specific management is in reducing the cost of inputs and environmental impact, but could increase risk.},

abstract = {Most of the atmospheric moisture in systems moving across South Africa leaves the sub-continent as the weather systems move out over the ocean, only a tenth of it falls on the landmass as rain. An increase in the efficiency of the atmospheric moisture delivery system by means of rainfall enhancement is therefore an attractive concept. Rainfall enhancement functions by either providing additional Cloud Condensation Nuclei or Ice forming Nuclei that will beneficially influence the precipitation formation process, improving the efficiency of moisture to rainfall conversion. Systematic South African research into rainfall enhancement started in the 1970s. The South African Rainfall Enhancement Programme (SAREP), initiated in the late 1990s, is the most recent in a series of studies and was the first semi-operational rainfall enhancement project to occur in South Africa as a response to drought conditions. In a recent study (DWAF, 2004) to finalise SAREP and provide guidance on operationalising rainfall enhancement, it was recommended that environmental impact assessment must be undertaken before this technology is implemented further. Rainfall enhancement falls specifically within the jurisdiction of the National Water Act (NWA) and the National Environmental Management Act (NEMA). A licence to undertake rainfall enhancement activities is required from the Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry after an appropriate environmental impact assessment has been undertaken to inform his decision. This paper proposes an approach to fulfil the legal requirements for operationalising future rainfall enhancement. The interaction between the science of rainfall enhancement and the ability of scientific disciplines to determine relevant environmental impacts, to appropriately inform the decision-making process, is specifically highlighted. The data requirements identified by scientists during the study varies in duration and resource needs and does not differentiate between ongoing scientific research and the requisite information required for informed decision making. This paper contemplates an approach which provides for holistic and co-ordinated investigation of South African rainfall enhancement into the future.

abstract = {AbstractThe nucleation of cloud droplets from the ambient aerosol is a critical physical process which must be resolved for global models to faithfully predict aerosol-cloud interactions and aerosol indirect effects on climate. In order to better represent droplet nucleation from a complex, multi-modal and multi-component aerosol population within the context of a global model, a new metamodeling framework is applied to derive an efficient and accurate activation parameterization. The framework applies polynomial chaos expansion to a detailed parcel model in order to derive an emulator which maps thermodynamic and aerosol parameters to the supersaturation maximum achieved in an adiabatically ascending parcel and can be used to diagnose droplet number from a single lognormal aerosol mode. The emulator requires much less computational time to build, store, and evaluate than a high-dimensional lookup table. Compared to large sample sets from the detailed parcel model, the relative error in the predicted supe...},

While sulfate and some organic aerosol particles scatter solar radiation back into space and can cool Earth's surface, they also change the actinic flux of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Observations and numerical models show that UV-scattering particles in the boundary layer accelerate photochemical reactions and smog production, but UV-absorbing aerosols such as mineral dust and soot inhibit smog production. Results could have major implications for the control of air pollution.},

Based on composition, morphology, and microstructure, three distinct types of carbonaceous particles were present in the smoke: organic particles with inorganic K- salt) inclusions, tar ball'' particles, and soot. The relative number concentrations of organic particles were largest in young smoke, whereas tar balls were dominant in a slightly aged similar to 1 hour) smoke from a smoldering fire. Flaming fires emitted relatively more soot particles than smoldering fires, but soot was a minor constituent of all studied plumes. Further aging caused the accumulation of sulfate on organic and soot particles, as indicated by the large number of internally mixed organic/ sulfate and soot/ sulfate particles in the regional haze. Externally mixed ammonium sulfate particles dominated in the boundary layer hazes, whereas organic/ sulfate particles were the most abundant type in the upper hazes. Apparently, elevated haze layers were more strongly affected by biomass smoke than those within the boundary layer. Based on size distributions and the observed patterns of internal mixing, we hypothesize that organic and soot particles are the cloud-nucleating constituents of biomass smoke aerosols. Sea- salt particles dominated in the samples taken in stratus clouds over the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Namibia, whereas a distinct haze layer above the clouds consisted of aged biomass smoke particles.},

abstract = {A Regional Air Quality Model System (RAQMS) is utilized to investigate the spatial and temporal distributions of PM10 concentrations and soil dust aerosol over East Asia in March 2010, when a severe dust storm occurred on 19-23 March. Dust aerosols were primarily generated in Gobi Deserts on 19 March and then swept across vast areas of East Asia. Model results are verified by in-situ observations from 17 Chinese cities, satellite retrievals, as well as lidar measurements in Japan. Validations demonstrate a good skill of RAQMS in representing the distribution and variation of PM10 concentrations and the major features of dust storm evolution. In general, the model performs better in the eastern parts of China than that in the western parts of China. Monthly mean surface PM10 concentrations were above 400 ug m-3 in west China, about 200-400 ug m-3 in north and central China, and below 100 ug m-3 in the remaining parts of China and East Asia. Dust aerosol was the major contributor to PM10 mass concentration during the study period, accounting for more than 80{\%} in west China, 30{\%}-60{\%} in north and central China, and about 20{\%}-40{\%} in south China and the western Pacific regions. The dust storm in March 2010 was unique in its influential extent and transport pathway because it impacted as far as the Pearl River Delta of China, such as Hong Kong. Interannual variability of dust budget is analyzed, showing the dust emission, deposition and atmospheric loading in March 2010 are all larger than those in 2002 and 2006. Of the total dust emission (110.4 Mt), about 68{\%} was redeposited onto the underlying surface by dry and wet deposition processes, and the remaining 32{\%} was suspended in the atmosphere or subject to long-range transport. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

A number of critical atmospheric chemical problems depend on the earth's "oxidizing capacity," which is essentially the global burden of these oxidants. There is limited direct evidence for changes in the earth's oxidizing capacity since recent preindustrial times when, because of industrial and population growth, increasing amounts of O3 precursor trace gases (carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons) have been released into the atmosphere. The concentrations of O3 and possibly H2O2 have increased over large regions. Models predict that tropospheric O3 will increase approximately 0.3 to 1{\%} per year over the next 50 years with both positive and negative trends possible for OH and H2O2. Models and the observational network for oxidants are improving, but validation of global models is still at an early stage.},

temperatures reveals climate feedbacks within Earth's carbon cycle.
Coherence between interannual fluctuations in global-average temperature
and atmospheric CO2 has changed over time. Since 1979, at Mauna Loa
and other observation sites, interannual coherence exhibits a 90degC
phase lag that suggests a direct correlation between temperatures
and the time-derivative of CO2. The coherence transition can be explained
if the response time of CO2 to a global temperature fluctuation has
lengthened from 6 months to at least 15 months. A longer response
time may reflect saturation of the oceanic carbon sink, but a transient
shift in ocean circulation may play a role. Coherent annual-cycle
fluctuations in CO2 and temperature are evident in the 1958 time
series, but not since 1979. Coherence of interannual CO2 variations
with gridpoint temperature anomalies are strongest in the tropical

abstract = {The effect of trade liberalisation on environmental conditions has yielded significant debate in the energy economics literature. Although research on the relationship between energy consumption, emissions and economic growth is not new in South Africa, no study specifically addresses the role that South Africa's foreign trade plays in this context. A surprising fact given trade is one of the most important factors that can explain the environmental Kuznets curve. This study employs recent South African trade and energy data and modern econometric techniques to investigate this. The main finding of interest in this paper is the existence of a long run relationship between environmental quality, levels of per capita energy use and foreign trade in South Africa. As anticipated per capita energy use has a significant long run effect in raising the country's CO2 emission levels, yet surprisingly higher levels of trade for the country act to reduce these emissions. Granger causality tests confirm the existence of a positive bidirectional relationship between per capita energy use and CO2 emissions. Whilst the study also finds positive bidirectional causality between trade and income per capita and between trade and per capita energy use, it appears however that trade liberalisation in South Africa has not contributed to a long run growth in pollution-intensive activities nor higher emission levels. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Based on experience made in various Alpine countries, the advantage of radar to grasp the present weather situation is discussed (e.g. for nowcasting purposes). Often, we spend too much effort in discussing sophisticated algorithms for solving special aspects. When aiming to apply radar data in a quantitative way, errors involved (such as shielding, clutter, beam-resolution, attenuation, variability of the Z-R-relationship and calibration) may let us forget the dominant advantage of radar: to tell us in detail when and where something is happening. Of course we should make the best estimate of e.g. the rain arriving at ground level. But for many applications a rough estimate of the precipitation intensity (together with its uncertainty) may already be helpful and more realistic, than to try obtaining the accuracy needed to distinguish a 'disastrous' precipitation from 'just a strong' one.

Foreknowledge of temperature and rainfall conditions can assist planning, management and mitigation decisions for users from many sectors of the economy. Pre-requisites of a useful seasonal forecast, however, would include ease of interpretation, acceptable accuracy as well as efficient dissemination. This paper describes the process of the development, dissemination and use of seasonal climate forecasts in South Africa. We critically analyse the process and suggest proposals for further research and development. Also addressed are the needs of users, maximisation of potential forecast benefits and some proposals for more efficient distribution.},

@article{Grosvenor2018,
abstract = {The cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) is of central interest to improve the understanding of cloud physics and for quantifying the effective radiative forcing by aerosol‐cloud interactions. Current standard satellite retrievals do not operationally provide Nd, but it can be inferred from retrievals of cloud optical depth ($\tau$c) cloud droplet effective radius (re) and cloud top temperature. This review summarizes issues with this approach and quantifies uncertainties. A total relative uncertainty of 78{\%} is inferred for pixel‐level retrievals for relatively homogeneous, optically thick and unobscured stratiform clouds with favorable viewing geometry. The uncertainty is even greater if these conditions are not met. For averages over 1° ×1° regions the uncertainty is reduced to 54{\%} assuming random errors for instrument uncertainties. In contrast, the few evaluation studies against reference in situ observations suggest much better accuracy with little variability in the bias. More such studies are required for a better error characterization. Nd uncertainty is dominated by errors in re, and therefore, improvements in re retrievals would greatly improve the quality of the Nd retrievals. Recommendations are made for how this might be achieved. Some existing Nd data sets are compared and discussed, and best practices for the use of Nd data from current passive instruments (e.g., filtering criteria) are recommended. Emerging alternative Nd estimates are also considered. First, new ideas to use additional information from existing and upcoming spaceborne instruments are discussed, and second, approaches using high‐quality ground‐based observations are examined.},

abstract = {Daily PM2.5 samples were collected in Chengdu, a megacity in southwest China, for a period of one month in every season during 2009-2010. Mass concentrations of water-soluble inorganic ions, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), levoglucosan (LG), water soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and elements were determined to identify the chemical characteristics and potential sources of PM2.5. The data obtained in spring were discussed in detail to explore the impacts of dust storms and biomass burning on the chemical aerosol properties. The daily PM2.5 mass concentrations ranged from 49.2 to 425.0??gm-3 with an annual average of 165.1??85.1??gm-3. The highest seasonal average of PM2.5 concentrations was observed in the winter (225.5??73.2??gm-3) and the lowest in the summer (113.5??39.3??gm-3). Dust storm influence was observed only during the spring, while biomass burning activities occurred frequently in late spring and early summer. In the spring season, water-soluble ions, total carbonaceous aerosols, and the sum of the dominant elements (Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, and Cu) accounted for 30.0??9.3{\%}, 38.6??11.4{\%}, and 6.2??5.3{\%}, respectively, of the total PM2.5 mass. Crustal element levels evidently increased during the dust storm episode and LG, OC, WSOC, Cl- and K+ concentrations increased by a factor of 2-7 during biomass burning episodes. Using the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor model, four sources for spring aerosols were identified, including secondary sulfate and nitrate, motor vehicle emissions, soil dust, and biomass burning. The four sources were estimated to contribute 24.6{\%}, 18.8{\%}, 23.6{\%} and 33.0{\%}, respectively, to the total PM2.5 mass. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Global warming is occurring at an alarming rate and predictions are that air temperature (T a) will continue to increase during this century. Increases in T a as a result of unabated production of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere pose a threat to the distribution and abundance of wildlife populations worldwide. Although all the animals worldwide will likely be affected by global warming, diurnal animals in the deserts will be particularly threatened in the future because T as are already high, and animals have limited access to water. It is expected that Saudi Arabia will experience a 3-5°C in T a over the next century. For predicting the consequences of global warming for animals, it is important to understand how individual species will respond to higher air temperatures. We think that populations will not have sufficient time to make evolutionary adjustments to higher T a, and therefore they will be forced to alter their distribution patterns, or make phenotypic adjustments in their ability to cope with high T a. This report examines how increases in T a might affect body temperature (T b) in the animals of arid regions. We chose three taxonomic groups, mammals, birds, and reptiles (Arabian oryx, Arabian spiny-tailed lizard, vultures, and hoopoe larks) from Saudi Arabia, an area in which T a often reaches 45°C during midday in summer. When T a exceeds T b, animals must resort to behavioral and physiological methods to control their T b; failure to do so results in death. The observations of this study show that in many cases T b is already close to the upper lethal limit of around 47°C in these species and therefore allowing their T b to increase as T a increases are not an option. We conclude that global warming will have a detrimental impact on a wide range of desert animals, but in reality we know little about the ability of most animals to cope with change in T a. The data presented should serve as base-line information on T b of animals in the Kingdom for future scientists in Saudi Arabia as they explore the impact of global warming on animal species. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Kinematic air parcel trajectory analysis is used to determine patterns of horizontal air transport in 2000 km x 2000 km areas over southern Africa. From these, composite zonal and meridional transport fields are derived for the subcontinent to estimate the extent to which recirculation of air and aerosols may take place in the lower troposphere between the surface and 500 hPa. The nature and degree of recirculation beneath the persistent 500-hPa absolutely stable layer is demonstrated, and transport by recirculation in discrete streams is shown to constitute 44{\%} of the total transport over the region. From a determination of air volume fluxes and estimates of aerosol concentrations, the total mass flux of aerosols by direct transport and by recirculation in conditions during which semipermanent, subtropical, continental anticyclones prevail is estimated to be about 51 Mton yr(-1) in the surface-to-500-hPa layer. Recirculation comprises approximately 22 Mton yr(-1) of this amount. Of the recirculated transport, about 5 Mton yr(-1) is recirculated to the west in easterly transport and 17 Mton yr(-1) to the east in westerly transport. [References: 55]},

abstract = {Abstract The analysis of airborne Doppler lidar data taken by NASA near the top of the planetary boundary layer in the central valley of California is presented. These data include downward wan angles that intercept the ground. The maximum errors in the radial speeds, based on the apparent speed of the ground strikes, was found to have a magnitude of less than 2.0 m s−1. These errors appear to have a slowly varying systematic part and a random part. The tidal radial speeds were corrected for running averages of these errors resulting in a random residual error of less than 0.3 m s−1 in magnitude. Data are considered usable for those range bins in which the return signal amplitude exceeds that of the average shot noise by two times the rms variation in the noise. These data were analyzed to produce wind vectors on a geographic grid divided into 1 kilometer square cells. The resulting wind field appears to be very realistic and contains features similar to those apparent in ground level wind observations. T...},

abstract = {Existing methods for dynamic calibration of tipping-bucket rain gauges (TBRs) can be time consuming and labor intensive. A new automated dynamic calibration system has been developed to calibrate TBRs with minimal effort. The system consists of a programmable pump, datalogger, digital balance, and computer. Calibration is performed in two steps: 1) pump calibration and 2) rain gauge calibration. Pump calibration ensures precise control of water flow rates delivered to the rain gauge funnel; rain gauge calibration ensures precise conversion of bucket tip times to actual rainfall rates. Calibration of the pump and one rain gauge for 10 selected pump rates typically requires about 8 h. Data files generated during rain gauge calibration are used to compute rainfall intensities and amounts from a record of bucket tip times collected in the field. The system was tested using 5 types of commercial TBRs (15.2-, 20.3-, and 30.5-cm diameters; 0.1-, 0.2-, and 1.0-mm resolutions) and using 14 TBRs of a single type (20.3-cm diameter; 0.1-mm resolution). Ten pump rates ranging from 3 to 154 mL min[sup-1] were used to calibrate the TBRs and represented rainfall rates between 6 and 254 mm h[sup-1] depending on the rain gauge diameter. All pump calibration results were very linear with R[sup2] values greater than 0.99. All rain gauges exhibited large nonlinear underestimation errors (between 5{\%} and 29{\%}) that decreased with increasing rain gauge resolution and increased with increasing rainfall rate, especially for rates greater than 50 mm h[sup-1]. Calibration curves of bucket tip time against the reciprocal of the true pump rate for all rain gauges also were linear with R 2 values of 0.99. Calibration data for the 14 rain gauges of the same type were very similar, as indicated by slope values that were within 14{\%} of each other and ranged from about 367 to 417 s mm h[sup-1]. The developed system can calibrate TBRs efficiently, accurately, and virtually unattended and could... [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] },

abstract = {Precipitation (P) is conventionally used for determining monsoon onset/retreat.
It can roughly separate monsoon regions from nonmonsoon regions.
Zeng and Lu (2004) found that precipitable water (W) can also determine
the monsoon onset/retreat but cannot determine the monsoon regions.
Temporal-spatial behaviors of P and W are compared in this article
with observed data and results of previous theoretical analyses,
and the comparison is used to understand the performances of P and
W in determining the monsoon onset/retreat and monsoon regions. It
is shown that W increases everywhere from winter to summer, dominated
by the large seasonal change of temperature. P increases from winter
to summer mainly in monsoon regions; it decreases or does not change
much in most of the nonmonsoon regions. Whether P increases or not
from winter to summer depends on whether the increase of W is greater
than the increase of temperature. Synoptic variations of P and W
have positive correlations everywhere. The increases of P and W from
winter to summer in monsoon regions make both able to determine the
climatic monsoon onset and retreat. The positive correlations of
daily P and W in monsoon onset and retreat seasons make the interannual
variations of the monsoon onset and retreat determined from P able
to be determined from W. The decrease or small change of P from winter
to summer in most of the nonmonsoon regions and the increase of W
in nonmonsoon regions make P able to roughly determine the monsoon
regions while W fails to.},

abstract = {In-situ measurements in convective clouds (up to the freezing level) over the Amazon basin show that smoke from deforestation fires prevents clouds from precipitating until they acquire a vertical development of at least 4 km, compared to only 1–2 km in clean clouds. The average cloud depth required for the onset of warm rain increased by {\~{}}350 m for each additional 100 cloud condensation nuclei per cm3 at a super-saturation of 0.5{\%} (CCN0.5{\%}). In polluted clouds, the diameter of modal liquid water content grows much slower with cloud depth (at least by a factor of {\~{}}2), due to the large number of droplets that compete for available water and to the suppressed coalescence processes. Contrary to what other studies have suggested, we did not observe this effect to reach saturation at 3000 or more accumulation mode particles per cm3. The CCN0.5{\%} concentration was found to be a very good predictor for the cloud depth required for the onset of warm precipitation and other microphysical factors, leaving only a secondary role for the updraft velocities in determining the cloud drop size distributions. The effective radius of the cloud droplets (re) was found to be a quite robust parameter for a given environment and cloud depth, showing only a small effect of partial droplet evaporation from the cloud's mixing with its drier environment. This supports one of the basic assumptions of satellite analysis of cloud microphysical processes: the ability to look at different cloud top heights in the same region and regard their re as if they had been measured inside one well developed cloud. The dependence of re on the adiabatic fraction decreased higher in the clouds, especially for cleaner conditions, and disappeared at re≥{\~{}}10 $\mu$m. We propose that droplet coalescence, which is at its peak when warm rain is formed in the cloud at re={\~{}}10 $\mu$m, continues to be significant during the cloud's mixing with the entrained air, cancelling out the decrease in re due to evaporation.},

abstract = {AIMS AND METHODS: Long term effects of air pollution on mortality were studied in 14,284 adults who resided in 24 areas from seven French cities when enrolled in the PAARC survey (air pollution and chronic respiratory diseases) in 1974. Daily measurements of sulphur dioxide, total suspended particles, black smoke, nitrogen dioxide, and nitric oxide were made in 24 areas for three years (1974-76). Cox proportional hazards models controlling for individual confounders (smoking, educational level, body mass index, occupational exposure) were applied, and frailty models used to take into account spatial correlation. Indicators of air pollution were the mean concentration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Models were run before and after exclusion of six area monitors influenced by local traffic (NO/NO2 {\textgreater}3 in ppb). After exclusion of these areas, analyses showed that adjusted risk ratios (95{\%} CI) for TSP, BS, NO2, and NO for non-accidental mortality were 1.05 (1.02 to 1.08), 1.07 (1.03 to 1.10), 1.14 (1.03 to 1.25), and 1.11 (1.05 to 1.17) for 10 microg/m3 respectively.

abstract = {CONTEXT: Associations have been found between day-to-day particulate air pollution and increased risk of various adverse health outcomes, including cardiopulmonary mortality. However, studies of health effects of long-term particulate air pollution have been less conclusive. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution and all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Vital status and cause of death data were collected by the American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention II study, an ongoing prospective mortality study, which enrolled approximately 1.2 million adults in 1982. Participants completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor data for approximately 500 000 adults were linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas throughout the United States and combined with vital status and cause of death data through December 31, 1998. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. RESULTS: Fine particulate and sulfur oxide--related pollution were associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each 10-microg/m(3) elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4{\%}, 6{\%}, and 8{\%} increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively. Measures of coarse particle fraction and total suspended particles were not consistently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Long-term exposure to combustion-related fine particulate air pollution is an important environmental risk factor for cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality.},

abstract = {It is well known that the United States has the greatest number of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes of any nation worldwide. Therefore, in the United States, a substantial infrastructure has evolved in response to the numerous natural hazards (not limited to severe thunderstorms and tornadoes) in an effort to reduce the societal impacts of these hazards. In addition to keeping records of the events, there are state and national programs (public and private) to help reduce the economic and social impacts on local communities that might otherwise have to prepare for severe storms and rebuild using only the limited local resources. This paper reviews the basics of the infrastructure that has been developed to deal with severe thunderstorms and tornadoes, and describes its history briefly, as well as considering some of its successes and problems. Although the American system should not be used as a simple template for Europe, it does need to be considered as Europe begins to address how to deal with the unique character of European severe storm hazards. Given that severe thunderstorm and tornado event frequencies are generally lower in Europe, as well as the smaller areas of individual European nations, each country has a correspondingly low annual event frequency, especially for the rare "high end" events that have the potential create major disasters. Collectively, however, the severe weather threat is almost certainly larger for Europe as a whole than most Europeans realize. Any decision concerning the phenomena that will be considered "severe weather" in Europe needs to be made in a purely European context. It is suggested that severe weather is best dealt with as the pan-European hazard it truly represents. Pan-European severe weather forecasting and research centers are proposed and issues that will need to be confronted are reviewed. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract Mesoscale meteorological data present their own challenges and advantages during the quality assurance (QA) process because of their variability in both space and time. To ensure data quality, it is important to perform quality control at many different stages (e.g., sensor calibrations, automated tests, and manual assessment). As part of an ongoing refinement of quality assurance procedures, meteorologists with the Oklahoma Mesonet continually review advancements and techniques employed by other networks. This article's aim is to share those reviews and resources with scientists beginning or enhancing their own QA program. General QA considerations, general automated tests, and variable-specific tests and methods are discussed.},

abstract = {Predictability of precipitation is examined from storm to synoptic scales through an experimental approach using continent-scale radar composite images. The lifetime of radar reflectivity patterns in Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates is taken as a measure of predictability. The results are stratified according to scale, location, and time in order to determine how predictability depends on these parameters. Three companion papers give a detailed description of the methodology, and present results are obtained for 143 hours of North American warm season rainfall with emphasis on lifetime, scale dependence, optimum smoothing of forecast fields, and predictability in terms of probabilistic rainfall rates. This paper discusses the sources of forecast uncertainty and extends the analysis to a total of 1424 hours of rainfall. In a Lagrangian persistence framework the predictability problem can be separated into a component associated with growth of precipitation and a component associated with changes in the storm motion field. The role of changes in the motion field turned out to be small but not negligible. A stratification of lifetime according to location reveals the regions with high predictability and significant nonstationary storm motion. This work is of high practical significance for three reasons: First, Lagrangian persistence of radar patterns was proved to have skill for probabilistic precipitation nowcasting. The discussion of the sources of uncertainty provides a guideline for further improvements. Second, a scale- and location-dependent benchmark is obtained against which the progress of other precipitation forecasting techniques can be evaluated. And, third, the experimental approach to predictability presented in this paper is a valuable contribution to the fundamental question of predictability of precipitation.},

abstract = {South Africa's electricity consumption has shown a sharp increase since the early 1990s. Here we conduct a sectoral decomposition analysis of the electricity consumption for the period 1993-2006 to determine the main drivers responsible for this increase. The results show that the increase was mainly due to output or production related factors, with structural changes playing a secondary role. While there is some evidence of efficiency improvements, indicated here as a slowdown in the rate of increase of electricity intensity, it was not nearly sufficient to offset the combined production and structural effects that propelled electricity consumption forward.This general economy-wide statement, however, can be misleading since the results, in essence, are very sector specific and the inter-sectoral differences are substantial. Increases in production were proven to be part of the rising trend for all sectors. However, only five out of fourteen sectors were affected by efficiency improvements, while the structural changes affected the sectors' electricity consumption in different ways. These differences concerning the production, structural and efficiency effects on the sectors indicate the need for a sectoral approach in the energy policy-making of the country rather than a blanket or unilateral economy-wide approach. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

of the Harvard Lyman-$\alpha$ photofragment fluorescence hygrometer (HWV)
on the NASA ER-2 and WB-57 aircraft, we describe here the validation
process for HWV, which includes laboratory calibrations and intercomparisons
with other Harvard water vapor instruments at water vapor mixing
ratios from 0 to 10 ppmv, followed by in-flight intercomparisons
with the same Harvard hygrometers. The observed agreement exhibited
in the laboratory and during intercomparisons helps corroborate the
accuracy of HWV. In light of the validated accuracy of HWV, we present
and evaluate a series of intercomparisons with satellite and balloon
borne water vapor instruments made from the upper troposphere to
the lower stratosphere in the tropics and midlatitudes. Whether on
the NASA ER-2 or WB-57 aircraft, HWV has consistently measured about
1–1.5 ppmv higher than the balloon-borne NOAA/ESRL/GMD frost point
hygrometer (CMDL), the NOAA Cryogenic Frost point Hygrometer (CFH),
and the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Aura satellite in regions
of the atmosphere where water vapor is {\textless}10 ppmv. Comparisons in the
tropics with the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) on the Upper
Atmosphere Research Satellite show large variable differences near
the tropopause that converge to {\~{}}10{\%} above 460 K, with HWV higher.
Results we show from the Aqua Validation and Intercomparison Experiment
(AquaVIT) at the AIDA chamber in Karlsruhe do not reflect the observed
in-flight differences. We illustrate that the interpretation of the
results of comparisons between modeled and measured representations
of the seasonal cycle of water entering the lower tropical stratosphere
is dictated by which data set is used.},

abstract = {Under the direction of the AMS Steering Committee for the EPA Cooperative Agreement on air quality modeling, a small group of scientists was convened to review and recommend procedures to evaluate the performance of air quality models. Particular attention was paid to the operational use of models in regulatory settings. A number of general recommendations resulted from the workshop. The usefulness of models to aid decision makers in air quality management was reiterated. Concerns about the absolute, rather than the statistical, nature of air quality standards were raised, with a recommendation to reformulate standards accordingly. Model performance evaluation was suggested on the basis of differences between observed and predicted concentrations. The bias (average), the variance (noise), and the gross variability (gross error) of such differences were the recommended performance measures. In addition, correlation measures calculated in time, space, and jointly between observation and predictions were recommended. These measures and suggestions on how to apply them are outlined. Some qualification on the use of these measures for application to point sources using limited data sets was made. The workshop did not recommend any specific numerical standards for acceptable model performance, there was insufficient information to do this. Rather, considerations for evaluating model performance using statistically constructed confidence intervals and comparison against EPA's currently used models were suggested. Finally, areas in need of further research were identified. These include development and description of performance measures; application, especially to point source models; analysis of meteorological and air quality data, both existing and newly developed; and evaluation of diffusion modeling techniques. },

abstract = {One of the purposes of the Fourth Cloud Modeling Workshop was to compared different microphysical treatments. In this paper, the results of widely used bulk treatment and five versions of a detailed microphysical model are presented. Sensitivity analysis was made to investigate the effect of bulk parameterization, ice initiation technique, CCN concentration and collision efficiency of rimed ice crystal-drop collision. The results show that: (i) The mixing ratios of different species of hydrometeors calculated by bulk and one of the detailed models show some similarity. However, the processes of hail-graupel formation are different in the bulk and the detailed models. (ii) Using different ice initiation in the detailed models' different processes became important in the hail and graupel formation. (iii) In the case of higher CCN concentration, the mixing ratio of liquid water, hail and graupel were more sensitive to the value of collision efficiency of rimed ice crystal-drop collision. (iv) The Bergeron-Findeisen process does not work in the updraft core of a convective cloud. The vapor content was always over water saturation; moreover, the supersaturation gradually increased after the appearance of precipitation ice particles.},

abstract = {A climatic regionalization of Saudi Arabia that aims to classify the country into several homogenous groups is carried out, by grouping similar long-term climatological features for precipitation and air temperature. Twenty-seven stations are selected across Saudi Arabia for the analysis and 1985-2010 (26years) is chosen as the common period. The employed methodology is a combination of mathematical and statistical techniques (principal components analysis and correlation); and a rather subjective physically detailed comparison with the long-term climatology and topography for Saudi Arabia. Five groups have been identified: group A (Northern), B (Red Sea Coastal), C (Interior), D (Highland) and E (Southern). Each of the climatic groups exhibits a unique feature (with strong similarities among stations that belong to the same group), especially in terms of inter-annual fluctuations and the degree of seasonality. This simplified overview of climatic characteristics is beneficial for assisting with economic planning, especially for any semi-arid or arid land that is naturally vulnerable to climatic variability and extremes. The classification method used in this study, however, would be applicable for similar studies on regionalization in other regions.},

We used chemical ionization and electron impact mass spectrometry, gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer, a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, a cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometer, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy coupled to energy dispersive spectrometry. BrO radicals were formed using visible and UV photolysis of Br2 and CH2Br2 in the presence of ozone. We have analyzed the products in the gas phase, on suspended aerosols and on wall deposits, and identified HgBr, HgBrO/HgOBr, and HgO as reaction products. Mercury aerosols with a characteristic width of ca. 0.2 microm were observed as products. We herein discuss the implications of our results to the chemistry of atmospheric mercury and its potential implications in the biogeochemical cycling of mercury.},

abstract = {We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15{\%} (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

abstract = {In the oceans, ubiquitous microscopic phototrophs (phytoplankton) account for approximately half the production of organic matter on Earth. Analyses of satellite-derived phytoplankton concentration (available since 1979) have suggested decadal-scale fluctuations linked to climate forcing, but the length of this record is insufficient to resolve longer-term trends. Here we combine available ocean transparency measurements and in situ chlorophyll observations to estimate the time dependence of phytoplankton biomass at local, regional and global scales since 1899. We observe declines in eight out of ten ocean regions, and estimate a global rate of decline of approximately 1{\%} of the global median per year. Our analyses further reveal interannual to decadal phytoplankton fluctuations superimposed on long-term trends. These fluctuations are strongly correlated with basin-scale climate indices, whereas long-term declining trends are related to increasing sea surface temperatures. We conclude that global phytoplankton concentration has declined over the past century; this decline will need to be considered in future studies of marine ecosystems, geochemical cycling, ocean circulation and fisheries.},

abstract = {The monsoon flow influence on the diurnal variation of precipitation
over southeastern China (SEC) is examined using satellite rainfall
data, reanalysis data, and data sets from field experiments. The
low-level wind averaged over southern China is strongest at late
night or in early morning, which is inferred as diurnal monsoon variability
(DMV). Such nocturnal acceleration occurs frequently from presummer,
when monsoon flow becomes active. It usually develops in the warm
region south of frontal zone; it is related closely to the ageostrophic
component. In response to the DMV, rainfall over SEC increases remarkably,
especially during early morning when the wind maximum of southwesterlies
occurs. Prolonged organized mesoscale convection is the main cause
of this rainfall enhancement. On a diurnal timescale, the DMV may
regulate the warm, moist inflow that feeds the frontal zone, thereby
enhancing large-scale frontogenesis from late night to morning. On
a regional scale, the DMV, when coupling with local circulation diurnally,
enhances the southerlies on the east flanks of plateaus and over
the western SEC, generating convective instability successively there
through the early morning. Consequently, the organized mesoscale
convection is reinforced to produce more morning rainfall during
presummer over SEC area, especially over its western region.},

abstract = {Aerosol measurements over the tropical urban site of Hyderabad, India,
provide a way of determining the variability of the aerosol characteristics
over a duration of 1 year (October 2007 to September 2008). The meteorological
pattern over India, mainly driven by the regional monsoons, has a
great effect on the amount and size distribution of the aerosols.
Higher aerosol optical depth (AOD) values are observed in premonsoon,
while the variability of the Angstrom exponent seems to be more pronounced,
with higher values in winter and premonsoon and lower values in the
monsoon periods. The AOD at 500 nm (AOD500) is very large over Hyderabad,
varying from 0.46 +- 0.17 in postmonsoon to 0.65 in premonsoon periods.
A discrimination of the different aerosol types over Hyderabad is
also attempted using values of AOD500 and. Such discrimination is
rather difficult to interpret since a single aerosol type can partly
be identified only under specific conditions (e.g., anthropogenic
emissions, biomass burning or dust outbreaks), while the presence
of mixed aerosols, without dominance of the coarse or accumulation
mode, is the usual situation. According to the analysis the three
individual components of differing origin, composition and optical
characteristics are (1) an urban/industrial aerosol type composed
of aerosols produced locally and all year round by combustion activities
in the city or long-range transported (mainly in spring) biomass
burning, (2) an aerosol type of mineral origin raised by the wind
in the deserts (mainly in premonsoon) or constituting coarse-mode
aerosols under high relative humidity conditions mainly in the monsoon
period, and (3) an aerosol type with a marine influence under background
conditions occurring in monsoon and postmonsoon periods. Nevertheless,
the mixed or undetermined aerosol type dominates with percentages
varying from 44.3{\%} (premonsoon) to 72.9{\%} (postmonsoon). Spectral
AOD and data are analyzed to obtain information about the adequacy
of the simple use of the exponent for characterizing the aerosols.
This is achieved by taking advantage of the spectral variation of
lnAOD versus , the so-called curvature. The results show that the
spectral curvature can be effectively used as a tool for aerosol
types discrimination, since the fine-mode aerosols exhibit negative
curvature, while the coarse-mode particles are positive.},

abstract = {Biomass burning (BB) is the second largest source of trace gases and the largest source of primary fine carbonaceous particles in the global troposphere. Many recent BB studies have provided new emission factor (EF) measurements. This is especially true for non-methane organic compounds (NMOC), which influence secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and ozone formation. New EF should improve regional to global BB emissions estimates and therefore, the input for atmospheric models. In this work we present an up-to-date, comprehensive tabulation of EF for known pyrogenic species based on measurements made in smoke that has cooled to ambient temperature, but not yet undergone significant photochemical processing. All EFs are converted to one standard form (g compound emitted per kg dry biomass burned) using the carbon mass balance method and they are categorized into 14 fuel or vegetation types. Biomass burning terminology is defined to promote consistency. We compile a large number of measurements of biomass consumption per unit area for important fire types and summarize several recent estimates of global biomass consumption by the major types of biomass burning. Post emission processes are discussed to provide a context for the emission factor concept within overall atmospheric chemistry and also highlight the potential for rapid changes relative to the scale of some models or remote sensing products. Recent work shows that individual biomass fires emit significantly more gas-phase NMOC than previously thought and that including additional NMOC can improve photochemical model performance. A detailed global estimate suggests that BB emits at least 400 Tg yr(-1) of gas-phase NMOC, which is almost 3 times larger than most previous estimates. Selected recent results (e. g. measurements of HONO and the BB tracers HCN and CH(3)CN) are highlighted and key areas requiring future research are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {In Western Saudi Arabia, an extremely arid region, rainfall is characterized by extremely high spatial and temporal variability. Flash floods occur immediately after heavy, short rainstorms and destroy human lives and properties. Unfortunately, rainfall and runoff measurements, as well as records of their greatest magnitude, are very scarce. In this study, 20 rain gauges distributed in and around eight dry basins (wadis) in Western Saudi Arabia that have a recorded length of at least 30 years were examined. Log-Pearson type III and EV1 probability density functions (pdf's) were derived by analyzing the maximum annual daily rainfall with different return periods. The EV1 pdf demonstrated the best fit in most cases representing the 50-year return period and providing the best prediction. Hence, this data could be used when planning future project designs. Regional maps of maximum probable precipitation (PMP) and probable maximum flood (PMF) were also produced for the seven major basins. Results from this study can be used to determine future water projects and their management in arid regions.},

abstract = {The effect of road vehicle traffic pollution on asthma is still not
clearly understood. However, any effect is likely to be most marked
among those who live within 150 m of a main road, because this is
the distance within which concentrations of primary vehicle traffic
pollutants are raised above ambient background levels. We have investigated
the relation between proximity of the family home to the nearest
main road, estimated objectively using geographical information system
software, and the risk of wheeze in the past year in a case-control
sample of 6,147 primary schoolchildren (age 4 to 11 yr) and a random
cross-sectional sample of 3,709 secondary schoolchildren (age 11
to 16 yr) in Nottingham, United Kingdom. Among children living within
150 m of a main road, the risk of wheeze increased with increasing
proximity by an odds ratio (OR) of 1.08 (95{\%} confidence interval
[CI] 1.00 to 1.16) per 30-m increment in primary schoolchildren,
and 1.16 (1.02 to 1.32) in secondary schoolchildren. Most of the
increased risk was localized to within 90 m of the roadside. Among
primary schoolchildren, effects were stronger in girls than boys
(pinteraction = 0.02). Living within approximately 90 m of a main
road is associated with a proximity-related increase in the risk
of wheezing illness in children.},

In this study, we use location quotients to compare the extent of burglary in gated communities with burglary across the entire city of Tshwane, South Africa, as well as compare burglary in gated communities with burglary occurring within a series of buffer intervals immediately surrounding these communities. Finally, we identify what physical characteristics of gated communities differentiate between high and low burglary in these enclaves. Prior to expectations, we found that gated communities (and their immediate surrounding areas) are associated with increased levels of burglary. There are, however, a number of physical characteristics of gated communities which are associated with much lower burglary levels. The implications of our work from a crime prevention and development planning perspective are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {rn this paper, we describe the latest version of the dry deposition inferential model, which is used to estimate the deposition velocities (V-d) for SO2, O-3, HNO3, and particles with diameters less than 2 mu m. The dry deposition networks operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) use this model to estimate dry deposition on a weekly basis. This model uses a multilayer approach, discretizing the vegetated canopy into 20 layers. The use of canopy radiative transfer and simple wind profile models allows for estimates of stomatal (r(s)) and leaf boundary layer (r(b)) resistances to be determined at each layer in the plant canopy for both sunlit and shaded leaves. The effect of temperature, water stress, and vapor pressure deficits on the stomatal resistance (r(s)) have been included. Comparisons of modeled deposition velocities are made with extensive direct measurements performed at three different locations with different crops. The field experiment is discussed in some detail. Overall, modeled O-3 deposition velocities are in good agreement with measured values with the average mean bias for all surfaces of the order of 0.01 cm/s or less. For SO2, mean biases range from -0.05 for corn to 0.15 cm/s for soybeans, while for HNO3, they range from 0.09 for corn to 0.47 cm/s for pasture.},

In this paper, the effects both of the propellers of a turboprop aircraft and of the aircraft vortex system on the pressure and wind velocity measurements near the nose of the aircraft are examined. It is shown that, for a turboprop aircraft, the sensors mounted near the nose are affected directly (slipstream) or indirectly (lift increase) by the propellers. The propeller effects are more significant for pressure sensors located ahead of the propellers on the fuselage and are less significant for the small local flow angles measured at the nose of the aircraft. The first case is clearly realized during in-flight calibration maneuvers performed by a turboprop aircraft. A major flow distortion, which seriously affects the vertical wind velocity measurements near the nose of an aircraft, is the upwash induced mainly by the wing-bound v...},

lows since the late 1970s. Model simulations of U.S. 20th century

abstract = {Emissions of sulfur gases from both natural and anthropogenic sources strongly influence the chemistry of the atmosphere. To assess the relative importance of these sources we have combined the measurements of sulfur gases and fluxes during the past decade to create a global emission inventory. The inventory, which is divided into 12 latitude belts, takes into account the seasonal dependence of sulfur emissions from biogenic sources. The total emissions of sulfur gases from natural sources are approximately 0.79 Tmol S/a. These emissions are 16{\%} of the total sulfur emissions in the Northern Hemisphere and 58{\%} in the Southern Hemisphere. The inventory clearly shows the impact of anthropogenic sulfur emissions in the region between 35 and 50N.},

@article{Snyder2015,
abstract = {Observations and recent high-resolution numerical model simulations indicate that liquid water and partially frozen hydrometeors can be lofted considerably above the environmental 0 degree C level in the updrafts of convective storms owing to the warm thermal perturbation from latent heating within the updraft and to the noninstantaneous nature of drop freezing. Consequently, upward extensions of positive differential reflectivity (i.e., ZDR equal or greater than 1 dB)—called ZDR columns—may be a useful proxy for detecting the initiation of new convective storms and examining the evolution of convective storm updrafts. High-resolution numerical simulations with spectral bin microphysics and a polarimetric forward operator reveal a strong spatial association between updrafts and ZDR columns and show the utility of examining the structure and evolution of ZDR columns for assessing updraft evolution. This paper introduces an automated ZDR column algorithm designed to provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information pertinent to convective storm nowcasting. Although suboptimal vertical resolution above the 0 degree C level and limitations imposed by commonly used scanning strategies in the operational WSR-88D network can complicate ZDR column detection, examples provided herein show that the algorithm can provide operational and research-focused meteorologists with valuable information about the evolution of convective storms.},

This paper argues that quality assurance determinations need to take account of how and to what extent students engage with activities that are likely to lead to productive learning. The idea of student engagement is introduced. A critical review of current possibilities for determining the quality of university education in Australia exposes limitations of quality assurance systems that fail to take account of student engagement. The review provides a basis for suggesting the broad relevance of student engagement to quality assurance. A sketch is provided of an approach for factoring student engagement data into quality assurance determinations.},

abstract = {The Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) model is one of several receptor models that have been applied to air quality management. This model quantifies contributions using chemical signatures characterizing source-types rather than contributions from individual emitters. The CMB model uses the chemical composition of ambient pollution samples to estimate the contributions of different source types to the measured pollutant concentrations. The disadvantage of the model is that it cannot separate the sources having similar chemical compositions or for those sources for which source composition profiles are unavailable. Since CMB analysis is done on a sample-by- sample basis, it is possible to estimate the daily contributions of individual sources, and can thereby provide useful information based on a limited number of samples to address air quality management issues. Samples of fine and coarse fractions of airborne particulate matter (PM) were collected using a ‘Gent' stacked filter unit in two fractions of 0-2.2 $\mu$m and 2.2-10 $\mu$m sizes in a semi-residential (Atomic Energy Centre Dhaka, AECD) area from June 2001 to June 2002 of Dhaka. These samples were analyzed for elemental concentrations with PIXE. The chemical composition data set was analyzed by CMB using local source profiles obtained using a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and regression analysis of data from this site and the source contributions are quantitatively estimated for each of the samples. The results of the CMB analysis were compared with the results obtained using positive matrix factorization (PMF) that had been done previously. It is observed that CMB provides comparable results except for limited discrepancies, especially for the PM2.2 fractions where sources have similar elemental signatures. Keywords:},

Analysis (GPA) approach, a chemical dispersion model provides a toxic

Iowa, to determine whether different racial and income groups are
disproportionately affected by the hazards from accidents. The locations
of 45 intersections that experienced the highest frequency of truck
accidents from 1990 to 1992 were obtained. At each location, a plume
footprint was generated, based on the release of chlorine, a commonly
transported toxic material in Des Moines. Similar plumes were generated
at 50 random locations in the city and similar estimates were made.
The results indicated that areas most likely to experience exposure
to hazardous materials transported by trucks were those with a higher
proportion of minorities and low-income households, as compared to
the city as a whole.},

Mounted on top of an aircraft and utilizing a self-contained, coupled Inertial Navigation System–GPS, STRAP actively keeps a set of uplooking radiometers horizontally level to within ±0.02° for aircraft pitch and roll angles of up to approximately ±10°. The system update rate of 100 Hz compensates for most pitch and roll changes experienced in normal flight and in turbulence. STRAP was mounted on a Twin Otter aircraft and its performance evaluated during normal flight and during a series of flight maneuvers designed to test the accuracy, range, and robustness of the platform.

@article{Dockery1993,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The overall rate of mortality due to ischemic heart disease is known to increase progressively with age. We evaluated the relation between the mortality rate and age in patients with first myocardial infarctions treated with thrombolytic therapy. METHODS: We studied 9720 patients with first infarctions who had been enrolled in the GISSI-2 trial. (This trial compared the efficacy of tissue plasminogen activator with that of streptokinase in patients with myocardial infarction.) Of these, only 35 percent had a history of angina. The relation between age and mortality during hospitalization and during the six months after discharge was determined by unadjusted and adjusted analyses. RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality rate was 1.9 percent among patients 40 years old or younger, but it increased to 31.9 percent among those more than 80 years old; however, values for indicators of infarct size did not increase with age. Autopsies were performed in 20 percent of the 772 patients who died in the hospital; the findings showed that the frequency of cardiac rupture increased from 19 percent among patients 60 years old or younger to 86 percent among those more than 70 years old. The mortality rate for the first six months after hospital discharge also increased significantly with age. After adjustment for confounding variables, older age continued to be significantly associated with a higher risk of in-hospital and post-discharge death. When age was introduced into a multivariate model as a continuous variable, the risk of death was estimated to increase by about 6 percent per year for both in-hospital and six-month mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with first myocardial infarctions who received thrombolytic therapy, age was a powerful independent predictor of both in-hospital and post-discharge mortality rates. The exponential, age-related increase in the mortality rate did not appear to be explained by larger infarcts.},

abstract = {Physics-based distributed (PBD) hydrologic models predict runoff throughout a basin using the laws of conservation of mass and momentum, and benefit from more accurate and representative precipitation input. V. flo??? is a gridded distributed hydrologic model that predicts runoff and continuously updates soil moisture. As a participating model in the second Distributed Model Intercomparison Project (DMIP2), V. flo??? is applied to the Illinois and Blue River basins in Oklahoma. Model parameters are derived from geospatial data for initial setup, and then adjusted to reproduce the observed flow under continuous time-series simulations and on an event basis. Simulation results demonstrate that certain runoff events are governed by saturation excess processes, while in others, infiltration-rate excess processes dominate. Streamflow prediction accuracy is enhanced when multi-sensor precipitation estimates (MPE) are bias corrected through re-analysis of the MPE provided in the DMIP2 experiment, resulting in gauge-corrected precipitation estimates (GCPE). Model calibration identified a set of parameters that minimized objective functions for errors in runoff volume and instantaneous discharge. Simulated streamflow for the Blue and Illinois River basins, have Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients between 0.61 and 0.68, respectively, for the 1996-2002 period using GCPE. The streamflow prediction accuracy improves by 74{\%} in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency when GCPE is used during the calibration period. Without model calibration, excellent agreement between hourly simulated and observed discharge is obtained for the Illinois, whereas in the Blue River, adjustment of parameters affecting both saturation and infiltration-rate excess processes were necessary. During the 1996-2002 period, GCPE input was more important than model calibration for the Blue River, while model calibration proved more important for the Illinois River. During the verification period (2002-2006), calibration was more important than GCPE input for the Illinois River, but both calibration and GCPE input improved prediction accuracy within the Blue River. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

A key feature of this paper is the rigorous computation Of ZH, ZDR and LDR using an electromagnetic model that is coupled to a detailed one-dimensional microphysical model of melting graupel. The graupel melting model was initialized with aircraft-measured graupel spectrum and sounding data. Two case studies during MAYPOLE '83 were considered where model-derived vertical profiles of ZH and ZDR were computed and compared to radar measurements, resulting in excellent agreement. The RHI profiles of ZH, ZDR and LDR through the core of an isolated convective storm revealed new and interesting microphysical data which are consistent with model computations. The radar measurements and model results of this paper show that a significant breakthrough has been made in the radar remote sensing of...},

In this investigation, the authors describe a new aircraft-borne aerosol inlet and its sampling characteristics for submicrometer particle measurements in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The new inlet is flown regularly on board a civil aircraft (Boeing 767 300ER) as part of the CARIBIC project. To investigate the sampling characteristics of the new inlet, a wind-tunnel study has been performed. Furthermore, particle transport losses in the sampling line have been calculated. Combining these results, an overall size-resolved inlet system sampling efficiency is given. During transport of the aerosol from the ambient environment to the measurement devices inside the aircraft, the aerosol experiences a strong heating within a few tenths of a second.

abstract = {This paper discusses the outline structure and preliminary evaluation of an emission-dispersion model for predicting the temporal and spatial distribution of vehicle-derived airborne particulate matter mass concentration in {\v{Z}}. street canyons. The model is called Street Level Air Quality SLAQ . SLAQ is semi-empirical, in that it uses not only results from field and wind tunnel experiments but also theory and models derived from multiple runs of numerical routines in order to simulate the basic physical processes within the street canyon. A combination of a plume model, for the direct contribution of vehicle exhaust, and a box model for the recirculating part of the pollutants in the street, is used to predict concentration for receptors within the canyon. Emission rates of vehicle-derived particulate matter are calculated within SLAQ, which serve as input to the dispersion module. Exhaust emission rates are scaled element by element along the street for each of the lanes according to the direction of traffic flow to account for modal operation of vehicles near signalised intersections. This refinement allows SLAQ to account for non-uniform- ity in along-canyon emission rates and to model a street that has several intersections along its length. Thermal turbulence due to environmental surface sensible heat and vehicle-generated heat is accounted for in the model. Other features of SLAQ include correction for the urban heat island effect, dry deposition, wet deposition, particle settling and estimation of wind direction standard deviation, when this latter data is not available. SLAQ has been evaluated in a street in Loughborough, Leicestershire, United Kingdom and a correlation coefficient of 0.8 between the modelled and measured concentrations has been obtained.},

abstract = {This paper presents an assessment of the air quality for the principal cities in developed and developing countries. Part of the vast and widely dispersed information on air quality that is available at this time on the Internet was compiled, thus making possible a comprehensive evaluation of the tendencies that emerged at the end of the 20th century. Likewise, these values are compared to the air quality thresholds recommended by two international organizations: guideline levels of the World Health Organization (WHO) and limit values of the European Union (EU), in order to determine air quality concentration levels in large cities around the world. The current situation of air quality worldwide indicates that SO(2) maintains a downward tendency throughout the world, with the exception of some Central American and Asian cities. NO(2) maintains levels very close to the WHO guideline value around the world. For particulate matter, it is a major problem in almost all of Asia, exceeding 300 microg/m(3) in many cities. Ozone shows average values that exceed the selected guideline values in all of the analyses demonstrating that it is a global problem. In general, the worldwide trend is to a reduction in the concentrations of pollutants because of the increasingly strong restrictions which local governments and international organizations impose. However, in poor countries and those with low average incomes, concentrations of air pollutants remain high and the trend will be the elevation of their ground levels as they develop, making the problem even worse.},

abstract = {This essay assumes that the ultimate expression of sovereignty resides, to a large degree, in the power and the capacity to dictate who may live and who must die. Hence, to kill or to allow to live constitute the limits of sovereignty, its fundamental attributes. To exercise sovereignty is to exercise control over mortality and to define life as the deployment and manifestation of power. One could summarize in the above terms what Michel Foucault meant by biopower: that domain of life over which power has taken control. But under what practical conditions is the right to kill, to allow to live, or to expose to death exercised? Who is the subject of this right? What does the implementation of such a right tell us about the person who is thus put to death and about the relation of enmity that sets that person against his or her murderer? Is the notion of biopower sufficient to account for the contemporary ways in which the political, under the guise of war, of resistance, or of the fight against terror, makes the murder of the enemy its primary and absolute objective? War, after all, is as much a means of achieving sovereignty as a way of exercising the right to kill. Imagining politics as a form of war, we must ask: What place is given to life, death, and the human body (in particular the wounded or slain body)? How are they inscribed in the order of power?},

The most intense British hailstorm reached intensity H8 on the TORRO international scale which extends from intensities H0 to H10. This paper focuses on over 800 hailstorms that reached TORRO intensity of H3 or more, the “severe” category. Analyses are presented for the historical period and the most recent 50-year period, 1950 to 1999. Consideration is given to examining the 50 most intense hailstorms (TORRO intensity H5–6 or more) known to have occurred in Britain since 1650. These storms all occurred between the months of May and September with a well-defined peak during July. These exceptional storms typically followed a track from the S, SSW or SW to the N, NNE or NE with a swath length of 25 km or more (reaching 335 km in one case) and a swath width sometimes in excess of 10 km.},

abstract = {A methodology is presented for the real-time automated identification, tracking, and short-term forecasting of thunderstorms based on volume-scan weather radar data. The emphasis is on the concepts upon which the methodology is based. A “storm” is defined as a contiguous region exceeding thresholds for reflectivity and size. Storms defined in this way are identified at discrete time intervals. An optimization scheme is employed to match the storms at one time with those at the following time, with some geometric logic to deal with mergers and splits. The short-term forecast of both position and size is based on a weighted linear fit to the storm track history data. The performance of the detection and forecast were evaluated for the summer 1991 season, and the results are presented.},

Expanding on the earlier analysis, it is shown that three modified forecast parameters have more value in distinguishing between environments that favor significant tornadoes and those that favor large hail but no significant tornadoes, in the climatological data. These parameters are storm-relative helicity in the 0–1-km layer adjacent to the ground, energy–helicity index computed from this measure of helicity, and the convective available potential energy that accrues from the surface to 3 km above ground level. In addition, this note provides caveats regarding the interpretation of the climatological findings.},

abstract = {Models and data suggest that the interplay of major climate modes
may result in climate shifts. More specifically it has been shown
that when the network of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Pacific
Decadal Oscillation (PDO), El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and
North Pacific Index (NPI) synchronizes, an increase in the coupling
between these oscillations destroys the synchronous state and leads
the climate system to a new state. These shifts are associated with
significant changes in global temperature trend and in ENSO variability.
Here we probe the details of this network's dynamics to investigate
if a certain oscillation is the culprit in these shifts. From a total
of 12 synchronization events observed in three climate simulations
and in observations we find that the instigator of these shifts is
NAO. Without exception only when NAO's coupling with the Pacific
increases a shift will occur. Our results suggest a dynamical sequence
of events in the evolution of climate shifts which is consistent
with recent independent empirical and modeling studies.},

@article{Blamey2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Severe thunderstorms pose a considerable risk to society and the economy of South Africa during the austral summer months (October–March). Yet, the frequency and distribution of such severe storms is poorly understood, which partly stems out of an inadequate observation network. Given the lack of observations, alternative methods have focused on the relationship between severe storms and their associated environments. One such approach is to use a combination of covariant discriminants, derived from gridded datasets, as a probabilistic proxy for the development of severe storms. These covariates describe some key ingredient for severe convective storm development, such as the presence of instability. Using a combination of convective available potential energy and deep-layer vertical shear from Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, this study establishes a climatology of potential severe convective environments across South Africa for the period 1979–2010. Results indicate that early austral summer months are most likely associated with conditions that are conducive to the development of severe storms over the interior of South Africa. The east coast of the country is a hotspot for potential severe convective environments throughout the summer months. This is likely due to the close proximity of the Agulhas Current, which produces high latent heat fluxes and acts as a key moisture source. No obvious relationship is established between the frequency of potential severe convective environments and the main large-scale modes of variability in the Southern Hemisphere, such as ENSO. This implies that several factors, possibly more localised, may modulate the spatial and temporal frequency of severe thunderstorms across the region.},

@article{Shneider2009,
abstract = {In this article I propose the classification of the evolutionary stages that a scientific discipline evolves through and the type of scientists that are the most productive at each stage. I believe that each scientific discipline evolves sequentially through four stages. Scientists at stage one introduce new objects and phenomena as subject matter for a new scientific discipline. To do this they have to introduce a new language adequately describing the subject matter. At stage two, scientists develop a toolbox of methods and techniques for the new discipline. Owing to this advancement in methodology, the spectrum of objects and phenomena that fall into the realm of the new science are further understood at this stage. Most of the specific knowledge is generated at the third stage, at which the highest number of original research publications is generated. The majority of third-stage investigation is based on the initial application of new research methods to objects and/or phenomena. The purpose of the fourth stage is to maintain and pass on scientific knowledge generated during the first three stages. Groundbreaking new discoveries are not made at this stage. However, new ways to present scientific information are generated, and crucial revisions are often made of the role of the discipline within the constantly evolving scientific environment. The very nature of each stage determines the optimal psychological type and modus operandi of the scientist operating within it. Thus, it is not only the talent and devotion of scientists that determines whether they are capable of contributing substantially but, rather, whether they have the 'right type' of talent for the chosen scientific discipline at that time. Understanding the four different evolutionary stages of a scientific discipline might be instrumental for many scientists in optimizing their career path, in addition to being useful in assembling scientific teams, precluding conflicts and maximizing productivity. The proposed model of scientific evolution might also be instrumental for society in organizing and managing the scientific process. No public policy aimed at stimulating the scientific process can be equally beneficial for all four stages. Attempts to apply the same criteria to scientists working on scientific disciplines at different stages of their scientific evolution would be stimulating for one and detrimental for another. In addition, researchers operating at a certain stage of scientific evolution might not possess the mindset adequate to evaluate and stimulate a discipline that is at a different evolutionary stage. This could be the reason for suboptimal implementation of otherwise well-conceived scientific policies. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Residential wood combustion is now recognized as a major particle source in many developed countries, and the number of studies investigating the negative health effects associated with wood smoke exposure is currently increasing. The combustion appliances in use today provide highly variable combustion conditions resulting in large variations in the physicochemical characteristics of the emitted particles. These differences in physicochemical properties are likely to influence the biological effects induced by the wood smoke particles.

OUTLINE: The focus of this review is to discuss the present knowledge on physicochemical properties of wood smoke particles from different combustion conditions in relation to wood smoke-induced health effects. In addition, the human wood smoke exposure in developed countries is explored in order to identify the particle characteristics that are relevant for experimental studies of wood smoke-induced health effects. Finally, recent experimental studies regarding wood smoke exposure are discussed with respect to the applied combustion conditions and particle properties.

CONCLUSION: Overall, the reviewed literature regarding the physicochemical properties of wood smoke particles provides a relatively clear picture of how these properties vary with the combustion conditions, whereas particle emissions from specific classes of combustion appliances are less well characterised. The major gaps in knowledge concern; (i) characterisation of the atmospheric transformations of wood smoke particles, (ii) characterisation of the physicochemical properties of wood smoke particles in ambient and indoor environments, and (iii) identification of the physicochemical properties that influence the biological effects of wood smoke particles.},

abstract = {It has long been known that cooking can create high concentrations of aerosol indoors. Increasingly, it is now being reported that cooking aerosol is also a significant component of outdoor particulate matter. As yet, the health consequences are unquantified, but the presence of well known chemical carcinogens is a clear indication that cooking aerosol cannot be benign. This review is concerned with current knowledge of the mass concentrations, size distribution and chemical composition of aerosol generated from typical styles of cooking as reported in the literature. It is found that cooking can generate both appreciable masses of aerosol at least within the area where the cooking takes place, that particle sizes are largely within the respirable size range and that major groups of chemical compounds which have been used to characterise cooking aerosol include alkanes, fatty acids, dicarboxylic acids, lactones, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkanones and sterols. Measured data, cooking emission profiles and source apportionment methods are briefly reviewed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The pollutant tropospheric ozone causes human health problems, and environmental degradation and acts as a potent greenhouse gas. Using long-term hourly observations at five US air quality monitoring surface stations we studied the seasonal and diel cycles of ozone concentrations and surface air temperature to examine the temporal evolution over the past two decades. Such an approach allows visualizing the impact of natural and anthropogenic processes on ozone; nocturnal inversion development, photochemistry, and stratospheric intrusion. Analysis of the result provides an option for determining the duration for a regulatory ozone season. The application of the method provides independent confirmation of observed changes and trends in the ozone and temperature data records as reported elsewhere. The results provide further evidence supporting the assertion that ozone reductions can be attributed to emission reductions as opposed to weather variation. Despite a (∼0.5 °C decade−1) daytime warming trend, ozone decreased by up to 6 ppb decade−1 during times of maximum temperature in the most polluted locations. Ozone also decreased across the emission reduction threshold of 2002 by 6–10 ppb indicating that emission reductions have been effective where and when it is most needed. Longer time series, and coupling with other data sources, may allow for the direct investigation of climate change influence on regional ozone air pollution formation and destruction over annual and daily time scales.},

abstract = {Following a comprehensive model evaluation in part 1, this part 2
paper describes results from 1 year process analysis and a number
of sensitivity simulations using the Community Multiscale Air Quality
(CMAQ) modeling system aimed to understand the formation mechanisms
of O3 and PM2.5, their impacts on global environment, and implications
for pollution control policies. Process analyses show that the most
influential processes for O3 in the planetary boundary layer (PBL)
are vertical and horizontal transport, gas-phase chemistry, and dry
deposition and those for PM2.5 are primary PM emissions, horizontal
transport, PM processes, and cloud processes. Exports of O3 and Ox
from the U.S. PBL to free troposphere occur primarily in summer and
at a rate of 0.16 and 0.65 Gmoles day?1, respectively. In contrast,
export of PM2.5 is found to occur during all seasons and at rates
of 25.68-34.18 Ggrams day?1, indicating a need to monitor and control
PM2.5 throughout the year. Among nine photochemical indicators examined,
the most robust include PH2O2/PHNO3, HCHO/NOy, and HCHO/NOz in winter
and summer, H2O2/(O3 + NO2) in winter, and NOy in summer. They indicate
a VOC-limited O3 chemistry in most areas in winter, but a NOx-limited
O3 chemistry in most areas except for major cities in April-November,
providing a rationale for nationwide NOx emission control and integrated
control of NOx and VOCs emissions for large cities during high O3
seasons (May-September). For sensitivity of PM2.5 to its precursors,
the adjusted gas ratio provides a more robust indicator than that
without adjustment, especially for areas with insufficient sulfate
neutralization in winter. NH4NO3 can be formed in most of the domain.
Integrated control of emissions of PM precursors such as SO2, NOx,
and NH3 are necessary for PM2.5 attainment. Among four types of VOCs
examined, O3 formation is primarily affected by isoprene and low
molecular weight anthropogenic VOCs, and PM2.5 formation is affected
largely by terpenes and isoprene. Under future emission scenarios,
surface O3 may increase in summer; surface PM2.5 may increase or
decrease. With 0.71degC increase in future surface temperatures in
summer, surface O3 may increase in most of the domain and surface
PM2.5 may decrease in the eastern U.S. but increase in the western
U.S.},

@article{West2005,
abstract = {Background concentrations of tropospheric ozone are increasing and are sensitive to methane emissions, yet methane mitigation is currently considered only for climate change. Methane control is shown here to be viable for ozone management. Identified global abatement measures can reduce approximately 10{\%} of anthropogenic methane emissions at a cost-savings, decreasing surface ozone by 0.4-0.7 ppb. Methane controls produce ozone reductions that are widespread globally and are realized gradually (approximately 12 yr). In contrast, controls on nitrogen oxides (NOx) and nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) target high-ozone episodes in polluted regions and affect ozone rapidly but have a smaller climate benefit. A coarse estimate of the monetized global benefits of ozone reductions for agriculture, forestry, and human health (neglecting ozone mortality) justifies reducing approximately 17{\%} of global anthropogenic methane emissions. If implemented, these controls would decrease ozone by -1 ppb and radiative forcing by approximately 0.12 W m(-2). We also find that climate-motivated methane reductions have air quality-related ancillary benefits comparable to those for CO2. Air quality planning should consider reducing methane emissions alongside NOx and NMVOCs, and because the benefits of methane controls are shared internationally, industrialized nations should consider emphasizing methane in the further development of climate change or ozone policies.},

The slope of ϕDP is an estimate of the specific differential phase KDP.

Filtering techniques are presented for separating $\delta$ from propagation phase and then estimating KDP and $\delta$. Also discussed are procedures for the estimation and interpretation of other radar measurables such as conventional radar reflectivity, differential reflectivity ZDP, the magnitude of the copolar correlation coefficient $\rho$HV(0), and Doppler spectrum width $\sigma$$\nu$. A low noise level is essential for accurate estimation of these parameters. A spectral domain technique that can eliminate some of the noise contained in radar time series data is presented.

This article introduces one of contemporary science's ‘hottest' ideas: namely, the proposition that the geological epoch during which Homo sapiens have flourished (the Holocene) is coming to an end.1 A number of environmental researchers spanning several disciplines believe that modern humans now rival those great forces of nature previously thought immune to human influence. They suggest we are entering (or have possibly entered) ‘the Anthropocene'. This is the first geological epoch where a step-change in Earth surface conditions has been caused, albeit unintentionally, by people's combined activities. The Anthropocence concept thus includes, but also transcends, the idea of anthropogenic climate change. As this article will show, although geographers are not its principal architects, the concept is enormously relevant to them. However, it should not be accepted uncritically. Both teachers and students need to appreciate the concept's origins, strengths and weaknesses. In what follows, I present a comprehensive, but succinct, survey of the Anthropocene proposition. I then point to the different ways it might be germane to geography looking ahead.},

Weather radar calibration is typically restricted to component level,
e.g. transmitter power measurements and receiver characterisation.
Waveguide system losses, antenna characteristics and radome properties
are generally assumed to be known constants without any variation
in time or antenna position.

In order to achieve a complete calibration of the radar system, it
is necessary to include the complete signal path through every radar
subsystem, from the transmitter output power to the receiver A/D
converter input. This requires external calibration activities with
active or passive tools. The different methods considered have been
classified into {\^{a}}¢ -Remote sources {\^{a}}¢ -Targets (active and passive)
{\^{a}}¢ -Existing tools for other types of radar (such as ATC radars)

abstract = {AbstractOver the past decade, the number of studies that investigate aerosol–cloud interactions has increased considerably. Although tremendous progress has been made to improve the understanding of basic physical mechanisms of aerosol–cloud interactions and reduce their uncertainties in climate forcing, there is still poor understanding of 1) some of the mechanisms that interact with each other over multiple spatial and temporal scales, 2) the feedbacks between microphysical and dynamical processes and between local-scale processes and large-scale circulations, and 3) the significance of cloud–aerosol interactions on weather systems as well as regional and global climate. This review focuses on recent theoretical studies and important mechanisms on aerosol–cloud interactions and discusses the significances of aerosol impacts on radiative forcing and precipitation extremes associated with different cloud systems.

abstract = {Changes induced by perturbed aerosol conditions in moderately deep (cloud top at about 5{\&}thinsp;km) mixed-phase convective clouds developing along sea-breeze convergence lines are investigated with high-resolution numerical model simulations (grid spacing of 250{\&}thinsp;m). The simulations utilise the newly developed Cloud-AeroSol Interacting Microphysics module (CASIM) for the Unified Model, which allows for the representation of the two-way interaction between cloud and aerosol fields. Simulations are evaluated against observations collected during the COPE field campaign over the southwestern peninsula of the UK in 2013. The simulations compare favourably with observed thermodynamic profiles, cloud-base cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC), cloud depth, and radar reflectivity statistics. Including the modification of aerosol fields by cloud microphysical processes in the simulations improves the match to observed cloud-base CDNC, increases the CDNC variability and leads to a larger decrease of CDNC with height above cloud base. However, it also reduces the average cloud size and cloud top height, which is less compatible with observations. Before clouds become organised along the sea-breeze convergence lines, precipitation is suppressed by increasing aerosol due to less efficient precipitation production by warm-phase microphysics. The precipitation suppression is less evident if aerosol processing is taken into account. After the sea breeze convergence zone is established, accumulated precipitation from the on average deeper and wider clouds increases with aerosol concentrations as long as cloud top heights are not limited by an upper level stable layer. The precipitation enhancement is controlled by changes in condensate production and precipitation efficiency. Enhanced condensate production in high aerosol scenarios is related to higher vertical velocities in the convective cores, i.e., convective invigoration, and stronger latent heating below the 0{\&}thinsp;°C level, while changes in latent heating in the mixed-phase region are negligible. Perturbed aerosol concentrations alter the cloud field structure with fewer larger cells developing in high aerosol environments, but inducing only small changes in cloud fraction. It is hypothesised that the stronger latent heating from convection is related to the changes in the cloud field structure reducing the mixing of environmental air into the convective core. For very high aerosol concentrations, the translation of convective invigoration into deeper clouds and enhanced precipitation is limited by thermodynamic constraints. The aerosol-induced changes in shallow warm-phase clouds prior to the development of a strong convergence zone is consistent with ideas based on parcel models. However, the precipitation response of the deeper mixed-phase clouds along well-established convergence lines suggest that when clouds begin to interact with the pre-existing thermodynamic environment and modifications to the cloud field structure occur, i.e., processes other than microphysics effect the cloud evolution, and the precipitation behaviour can be opposite to predictions from parcel models.},

abstract = {The retrieval algorithm for the High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder
(HIRDLS) instrument onboard NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura
satellite is presented. The algorithm is based on optimal estimation
theory, using a modified Levenberg-Marquardt approach for the iterative
solution. Overview of the retrieval scheme, convergence criteria,
and the forward models is given. Treatments of clouds and aerosols
as well as line-of-sight gradients in temperature are described.
The retrievals are characterized by high vertical resolution of 1
km and negligible a priori contribution for all products in regions
of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (most of the retrieval ranges).
It is shown that these characteristics hold for all latitudes along
a HIRDLS orbit. The weighting functions are narrow and show good
sensitivity to temperature or gas perturbations in regions of high
SNR. The retrieval error predicted by the algorithm consists of radiometric
noise, pointing jitter error, smoothing error, and forward model
error. For temperature, these components are shown for a midlatitude
profile as well as for a full orbit. The predicted temperature error
varies from 0.5 K to 0.8 K from the upper troposphere to the stratopause
region, consistent with the empirical estimates given by Gille et
al. (2008). For O3 and HNO3, the predicted errors and their useful
pressure ranges are, respectively, 10–5{\%} from 50 to 1 hPa and 5–10{\%}
from 100 to 10 hPa. These results are based on version V004 of the
retrieved data, released in August 2008 to the Goddard Earth Sciences

abstract = {Assuming that state-of-the-art air quality models are accurate, then
the precision and accuracy of their results directly depend on the
precision and accuracy of their geographical, meteorological and
emission input data. There are important applications, such as open
pit mining, in which emission data are the main source of uncertainty.
In such cases, historical air quality experimental data are typically
available. The present work proposes a backward air quality simulation
approach to assess the accuracy of emission inventories for these
applications, with the goal of identifying sources that are over
or underestimated. This approach consists of finding constants of
the linear combination of the estimated emission that maximize R
2 and make the slope equal to one in the linear correlation analysis
when the results from the air quality model are compared to the experimental
measurements of air quality. This methodology was applied to the
case of the mining region in northern Colombia. As one of the largest
open pit coal mining regions in the world, this region consists of
seven independent mines with no relevant additional sources of emission.
Use of the proposed methodology allowed quantification of the amount
by which companies over or underestimated their emission, as well
as quantification of uncertainties due to sources not considered
in the model but that locally affect each monitoring station.},

events linked to climate change? Using 20th century experiments submitted
for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment
Report (AR4), we show that a 19-model average IOD index over the
1950–1999 period yields an upward trend. The associated circulation
trends provide a favourable environment for pIOD development, leading
to a 17{\%} increase in pIOD frequency compared with the case in which
trends are removed. The majority of the increase manifests as a frequency
increase in the two- and three-consecutive events. The circulation
trends are in turn consistent with wind changes associated with a
weaker Walker circulation in the Pacific and an enhanced land-sea
temperature contrast in the Indian Ocean (IO) sector. Our results
suggest that although it is difficult to attribute the trigger of
the recent consecutive pIODs, climate change is increasing the occurrences
of such events.},

To attain the above aim the dissertation is broken up into several parts: • An analysis of historic natural catastrophes occurring in South Africa in terms of their frequency and severity (section 5), • Development of the exposures to natural catastrophe in terms of insured interest sub-divided into appropriate geographical regions (section 6), and •Development of models to quantify the effect that future catastrophic events may have on the insured interest in terms of damage caused and subsequent losses to be claimed (sections 7 to 11)},

It is shown that the calculated orientation angles are in good agreement with those measured by under-wing probes, and that the major cause of the preferential orientation of columns is the vortex generated at the tips of finite wings. It is also shown that a preferred orientation can be found in data obtained using fuselage-mounted probes, but there the agreement between the calculated and observed angles is not as good.},

National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) to look for weekly cycles
in lightning activity. As was found by Bell et al. (2008) for rain
over the southeast U.S., there is a significant weekly cycle in afternoon
lightning activity that peaks in the middle of the week there. The
weekly cycle appears to be reduced over population centers. Lightning
activity peaks on weekends over waters near the SE U.S. The statistical
significance of weekly cycles over the western half of the country
is generally small. We found no evidence of a weekly cycle of synoptic-scale
forcing that might explain these patterns. The lightning behavior
is entirely consistent with the explanation suggested by Bell et
al. (2008) for the cycles in rainfall and other atmospheric data
from the SE U.S., that aerosols can cause storms to intensify in
humid, convectively unstable environments.},

@article{Cheng2008,
abstract = {Rain-gauge networks are often used to provide estimates of area average rainfall or point rainfalls at ungauged locations. The level of accuracy a network can achieve depends on the total number and locations of gauges in the network. A geostatistical approach for evaluation and augmentation of an existing rain-gauge network is proposed in this study. Through variogram analysis, hourly rainfalls are shown to have higher spatial variability than annual rainfalls, with hourly Mei-Yu rainfalls having the highest spatial variability. A criterion using ordinary kriging variance is proposed to assess the accuracy of rainfall estimation using the acceptance probability defined as the probability that estimation error falls within a desired range. Based on the criterion, the percentage of the total area with acceptable accuracy Ap under certain network configuration can be calculated. A sequential algorithm is also proposed to prioritize rain-gauges of the existing network, identify the base network, and relocate non-base gauges. Percentage of the total area with acceptable accuracy is mostly contributed by the base network. In contrast, non-base gauges provide little contribution to Ap and are subject to removal or relocation. Using a case study in northern Taiwan, the proposed approach demonstrates that the identified base network which comprises of approximately two-thirds of the total rain-gauges can achieve almost the same level of performance (expressed in terms of percentage of the total area with acceptable accuracy) as the complete network for hourly Mei-Yu rainfall estimation. The percentage of area with acceptable accuracy can be raised from 56{\%} to 88{\%} using an augmented network. A threshold value for the percentage of area with acceptable accuracy is also recommended to help determine the number of non-base gauges which need to be relocated.},

abstract = {The AERMOD dispersion model was used to compute ambient air concentrations
of SO2 for 1-, 3-, and 24-h averaging periods using the emission
inventory data for Lucas County, Ohio for the year 1990. The estimated
concentrations were classified based on the stability parameter,
Monin{\^{a}}Obukhov length (L), for the two monitoring stations located
in the area. The data were divided into two atmospheric stability
classes (stable and convective cases) as used in the AERMOD model.
These categories were further grouped into five subcategories based
on the value of L to learn about fine details of model performance.
The model evaluation was done using several statistical parameters
used in air quality studies.AERMOD did not yield a satisfactory performance
in predicting 1- and 3-h average concentrations for the multisource
region but showed a slightly better performance in predicting the
24-h concentrations using urban option for the land use parameters.
The model had a tendency to underpredict in both the stable and convective
cases. In the 24-h averaging period factor of two (Fa2) values suggested
a better performance than fractional bias (FB). The model seemed
to perform better for the Main Street station than the Collins Park
station. Limited analysis using different land use parameters reported
in the paper indicates that model performance may improve for certain
cases. Other errors include the unavoidable scatter arising from
differences between wind direction and actual transport for an averaging
period, formulation of the model, and the emission inventory. The
results of the study should be used cautiously because of the limited
scope of the evaluation. Future work should focus on the role of
land use parameters in predicting concentrations at the monitors
and finding ways to quantify errors attributed to other factors.
However, it is clear that more guidance is needed to apply the AERMOD
model for multisource regions. Alternative schemes to divide the
data should also be considered for analyzing model performance. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright}

Data were collected at a coastal surface site, and on an aircraft that flew north (upwind) of the surface site during the CLOUDYCOLUMN portion of the second Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-2). In a closure study we compare observations, from five study days, and predictions based on K{\"{o}}hler and parcel theory. Measured and predicted cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) do agree after accounting for differences between the mobility equivalent (Dme) and sphere equivalent (Dse) diameters, but only when considering results from two study days unaffected by continental pollution. After applying the Dme − Dse correction, cloud droplet concentration closure was also achieved, or nearly achieved, on three study days. Discrepancies between predicted and measured CCN, or between predicted and measured droplet concentration, were always in the direction of predicted values being larger than that measured. Although theoretical studies do specify scenarios where droplet concentration and CCN overestimation can occur, the observed disparities may also be due to multiple and poorly characterized experimental biases.},

abstract = {Methane retrievals from the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer
for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) instrument onboard ENVISAT
provide important information on atmospheric CH4 sources, particularly
in tropical regions which are poorly monitored by in situ surface
observations. Recently, Frankenberg et al. (2008a, 2008b) reported
a major revision of SCIAMACHY retrievals due to an update of spectroscopic
parameters of water vapor and CH4. Here, we analyze the impact of
this revision on global and regional CH4 emissions estimates in 2004,
using the TM5-4DVAR inverse modeling system. Inversions based on
the revised SCIAMACHY retrievals yield 20{\%} lower tropical emissions
compared to the previous retrievals. The new retrievals improve significantly
the consistency between observed and assimilated column average mixing
ratios and the agreement with independent validation data. Furthermore,
the considerable latitudinal and seasonal bias correction of the
previous SCIAMACHY retrievals, derived in the TM5-4DVAR system by
simultaneously assimilating high-accuracy surface measurements, is
reduced by a factor 3. The inversions result in significant changes
in the spatial patterns of emissions and their seasonality compared
to the bottom-up inventories. Sensitivity tests were done to analyze
the robustness of retrieved emissions, revealing some dependence
on the applied a priori emission inventories and OH fields. Furthermore,
we performed a detailed validation of simulated CH4 mixing ratios
using NOAA ship and aircraft profile samples, as well as stratospheric
balloon samples, showing overall good agreement. We use the new SCIAMACHY
retrievals for a regional analysis of CH4 emissions from South America,
Africa, and Asia, exploiting the zooming capability of the TM5 model.
This allows a more detailed analysis of spatial emission patterns
and better comparison with aircraft profiles and independent regional
emission estimates available for South America. Large CH4 emissions
are attributed to various wetland regions in tropical South America
and Africa, seasonally varying and opposite in phase with CH4 emissions
from biomass burning. India, China and South East Asia are characterized
by pronounced emissions from rice paddies peaking in the third quarter
of the year, in addition to further anthropogenic emissions throughout
the year.},

abstract = {The Arabic word "haboob," meaning "strong wind," describes a weather phenomenon characterized by immense walls of blowing sand and dust.  Common to many parts of the Middle East, northern Affica, and the southwestern United States, haboobs are spawned by strong mesoscale downdrafts, making their prediction by coarse-grid numerical models difficult in comparison to dust forced by synoptic-scale dynamics.  The United Arab Emirates Unified Aerosol Experiment (UAE2), an extensive field program conducted over the southeastern Arabian Peninsula during the summer of 2004, provided a unique opportunity to observe the haboob activity common to this region by way of a large assortment of satellite, radar, lidar, and meteorological station network observations.  Here, we present results based on the UAE2 data set which add insight to the formation processes, multiscale structure, and transient behavior of haboobs as well as their potential importance to the regional aerosol burden.  Satellite imagery and surface radar data assisted in the interpretation of highly dynamic storm evolution and outflow interactions.  An idealized model of haboob dust production, parameterized by the strength and duration of the downburst, suggested that haboobs could be responsible for a nonnegligible component of the regional-scale total dust production (up to 30{\%} over a 1000 × 1000 km domain).},

This short article is based on years of training pharmacists, physicians, and other health care providers to become better speakers and communicators. It describes the most common mistakes speakers make and the best ways to correct those mistakes. Those mistakes include: (1) trying to tell too much, (2) not meeting the needs of the specific audience, (3) not having a clear purpose, (4) lacking clear organization, (5) speaking with a monotonous voice, (6) reading the talk without practicing, and (7) using poorly designed visual aids.

occasional similarity between the profiles of CO2 and aerosol concentrations,
though their temporal variations are not always coordinated because
of the effects of local sources or sinks. A sudden increase of downward
winds, due to the approach of an anticyclonic synoptic flow, resulted
in a rapid decrease in both the CO2 and aerosol concentrations in
the boundary layer. These observation results have demonstrated that
simultaneous measurements with airborne and ground-based instruments
set on the summit/foot of a mountain are useful for the study of
variability of CO2 concentration in the boundary layer.},

abstract = {Temporal and spatial characteristics of Saudi Arabian dust storms, with focus on associated air parcel trajectories, are investigated using station and gridded weather observations and remotely-sensed aerosol optical depth (AOD). For 13 focal stations, an extensive pool of 84-hour backward trajectories is developed for dust storm days, and the trajectories are grouped into 3-5 representative clusters based on the K-means technique and Silhouette Coefficients. Saudi Arabian dust storms are most prominent during February-June, with a mid-winter peak along the southern coast of the Red Sea, spring peak across northern Saudi Arabia around the An Nafud Desert, and early summer peak in eastern Saudi Arabia around the Ad Dahna Desert. Based on backward trajectories, the primary local dust source is the Rub Al Khali Desert and the primary remote sources are the Saharan Desert, for western Saudi Arabia, and Iraqi Deserts, for northern and eastern Saudi Arabia. During February-April, the Mediterranean storm track is active, with passing cyclones and associated cold fronts carrying Saharan dust to Saudi Arabian stations along the northern coast of the Red Sea. Across Saudi Arabia, the highest AOD is achieved during dust storms that originate from the Rub Al Khali and Iraqi Deserts. Most stations are dominated by local dust sources (primarily Rub Al Khali), are characterized by three dominant trajectory paths, and achieve AOD values exceeding 1. In contrast, for stations receiving predominantly remote dust (particularly Saharan), 3-5 trajectory paths emerge and AOD values only reach approximately 0.6 as dust is lost during transport.},

In this work, the techniques of principal component analysis (PCA) and stepwise multiple regression analysis were employed to identify and quantify the major sources which influence the ambient SPM. The mass contributions of the different sources were estimated by the calculation of absolute principal component scores (APCS), and a subsequent stepwise regression of the SPM concentrations using the APCS. The results indicated that the major classes of source which contribute to the ambient SPM in Korea are soil re-suspension, fuel combustion, motor vehicles, and secondary aerosols. The compilation of an extensive inventory of such sources is an essential task, so that a more detailed apportionment of their contributions to the SPM can be made in Korea.},

abstract = {The factors responsible for rare summertime rainfall over portions of
the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which have not been previously explored
in detail, are elucidated with the Climate Forecast System Re-analysis
and WRF mesoscale model simulations. The simulations show associations
between active phases of the southwest Asian monsoon and intensification
of the Arabian heat low, leading up to UAE rainfall events. Variability
in the location and strength of the Arabian heat low circulation, which
differs from the static portrayal in climatological minimum sea level
pressure (MSLP), can affect the development of deep convection over the
UAE. Analysis of the vorticity equation for a two-day case study period
confirms that convergence is solely responsible for the spinup and
maintenance of the primary heat low circulation. Convergence is also
responsible for the spinup of a separate cyclonic circulation over the
eastern UAE, which propagates offshore to the Arabian Gulf during
morning hours. This cyclonic circulation advects moist air onshore over
the western UAE, and deep convection follows from inland horizontal
convective rolls and interaction with the approaching sea-breeze front.
The development of widespread deep convection is shown to be most
favorable during the decay phase of the Arabian heat low, when the
preconditioned moist air is not replaced by drier continental flow, and
the vertical profiles of temperature and moisture are also more
favorable. Three other rainfall cases are briefly discussed to
illustrate how the strength and geographic position of the Arabian heat
low can affect rainfall characteristics over the UAE.},

abstract = {The design, laboratory calibrations, and flight tests of a new optical imaging instrument, the twodimensional stereo (2D-S) probe, are presented. Two orthogonal laser beams cross in the middle of the sample volume. Custom, high-speed, 128-photodiode linear arrays and electronics produce shadowgraph images with true 10-mu m pixel resolution at aircraft speeds up to 250 m s(-1). An overlap region is defined by the two laser beams, improving the sample volume boundaries and sizing of small ({\textless} similar to 100 mu m) particles, compared to conventional optical array probes. The stereo views of particles in the overlap region can also improve determination of three-dimensional properties of some particles. Data collected by three research aircraft are examined and discussed. The 2D-S sees fine details of ice crystals and small water drops coexisting in mixed-phase cloud. Measurements in warm cumuli collected by the NCAR C-130 during the Rain in Cumulus over the Ocean (RICO) project provide a test bed to compare the 2D-S with 2D cloud (2D-C) and 260X probes. The 2D-S sees thousands of cloud drops {\textless}similar to 150 mu m when the 2D-C and 260X probes see few or none. The data suggest that particle images and size distributions ranging from 25 to -150 mu m and collected at airspeeds {\textgreater} 100 m s(-1) by the 2D-C and 260X probes are probably (erroneously) generated from out-of-focus particles. Development of the 2D-S is in its infancy, and much work needs to be done to quantify its performance and generate software to analyze data.},

abstract = {Relationships between radar-derived hail kinetic energy and hail damage to residential and agricultural buildings are presented for nine hail cells that occurred over the Swiss Mittelland (1992-1999). Hail kinetic energy (EKINPIX) was calculated from C-band Doppler radar Constant Altitude Plan Position Indicators (CAPPIs) at a height of 1.5 km and daily hail damage claim data were available per Swiss community through several cantonal building insurance companies. In order to derive point-to-point relationships, hailfall and damage variables were triangulated on a 2×2-km grid and cross-correlation coefficients were then calculated for entire hail cells. The results show that high season hail storms (15 June-15 August) produced higher mean damage than low season storms (before and after) and weighted logistic damage functions produced correlation coefficients of 0.83 (0.86) for high (low) season storms over residential buildings and 0.79 (0.88) over agricultural buildings. The relationship between EKINPIX and total loss ratios (damage in relation to total sums insured) reveals no seasonal difference in hailstorm intensities and nonweighted logistic functions yield correlation coefficients of 0.85 (0.84) for residential (agricultural) buildings. The comparison between actual and predicted losses showed that nonweighted functions overestimated actual damage and that altered damage functions (flatter slope gradients) predicted damages that are in the range of the actual losses. Damage functions are calibrated using EKINPIX, total loss ratios and actual losses from two independent hail cells. One hail cell showed that damage induced through rainfall that followed hailfall multiplied the final loss considerably. The valuable agreement between radar-measured hailfall intensity and total loss ratios suggests that the established damage functions could be used by insurance companies to derive possible maximal hail losses to a building portfolio of interest. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Introduction There is still interest in a unified methodology to quantify the mass of particulate material emitted into the atmosphere by activities inherent to open-pit mining. For the case of total suspended particles (TSP), the current practice is to estimate such emissions by developing inventories based on the emission factors recommended by the USEPA for this purpose. However, there are disputes over the specific emission factors that must be used for each activity and the applicability of such factors to cases quite different to the ones under which they were obtained. There is also a need for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 {\^{I}}¼m (PM 10 ) emission inventories and for metrics to evaluate the emission control programs implemented by open-pit mines. Standardized emission inventory methodology To address these needs, work was carried out to establish a standardized TSP and PM 10 emission inventory methodology for open-pit mining areas. The proposed methodology was applied to seven of the eight mining companies operating in the northern part of Colombia, home to the one of the world{\^{a}}s largest open-pit coal mining operations ({\^{a}}¼70 Mt/year). Results The results obtained show that transport on unpaved roads is the mining activity that generates most of the emissions and that the total emissions may be reduced up to 72{\%} by spraying water on the unpaved roads. Performance metrics were defined for the emission control programs implemented by mining companies. It was found that coal open-pit mines are emitting 0.726 and 0.180 kg of TSP and PM 10 , respectively, per ton of coal produced. It was also found that these mines are using on average 1.148 m 2 of land per ton of coal produced per year.},

abstract = {Sounding parameters are examined to determine whether they can help distinguish between Alberta, Canada, severe thunderstorms that spawn significant tornadoes (F2–F4), weak tornadoes (F0–F1), or non- tornadic severe storms producing large hail. Parameters investigated included storm-relative helicity (SRH), precipitable water (PW), and storm convergence. The motivation for analyzing these parameters is that, in theory, they might affect the rate of change of vertical vorticity generation through vortex stretching, vortex tilting, and baroclinic effects. Precipitable water showed statistically significant differences between signifi- cant tornadic storms and those severe storms that produced weak tornadoes or no tornadoes. All significant tornadic cases in the dataset used had PW values exceeding 22 mm, with a median value of 24 mm. Values of PW between 19 and 23 mm were generally associated with weak tornadic storms. Computed values of storm convergence, height of the lifted condensation level, and normalized most unstable CAPE did not discriminate between any of the three storm categories. The SRH showed discrimination of significant tornadoes from both weak tornadic and nontornadic severe storm groups. The Alberta data suggest that significant tornadoes tended to occur with SRH{\textgreater}150m2 s-2 computed for the 0–3-km layer whereas weak tornadoes were typically formed for values between 30 and 150m2 s-2. Threshold values of SRH were lower than those suggested in studies based on storm observations throughout much of the United States.},

abstract = {Hailstorms are meteorological phenomena of great interest to the scientific community, owing to their socioeconomic impact, which is mainly on agricultural production. With its global coverage and high spatial and temporal resolution, satellite remote sensing can contribute to monitoring of such events through the development of appropriate techniques. This paper presents an extensive validation in the south of France of a hail detection tool (HDT) developed for the Middle Ebro Valley (MEV). The HDT is based on consecutive application of two filters, a convection mask (CM) and hail mask (HM), using spectral channels of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite. The south of France is an ideal area for studying hailstorms, because there is a robust database of hail falls recorded by an extensive network of hailpads managed by the Association Nationale d'Etude et de Lutte contre les Fle{\'{a}}ux Atmosph{\'{e}}riques (ANELFA). The results show noticeably poorer performance of the HDT in France relative to that in the MEV, with probability of detection (POD) 60.4{\%} and false alarm rate (FAR) 26.6{\%}. For this reason, a new tool to suit the characteristics of hailstorms in France has been developed. The France Hail Detection Tool (FHDT) was developed using logistic regression from channels of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) sensor of the MSG. The FHDT was validated, resulting in POD 69.3{\%} and FAR 15.4{\%}, thus improving hail detection in the study area as compared with the previous tool. The new tool was tested in a case study with satisfactory results, supporting its future practical application.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking and coal burning are the primary sources of indoor air pollution in Chinese households. However, effects of these exposures on Chinese children's respiratory health are not well characterized.

METHODS: Seventh grade students (N = 5051) from 22 randomly selected schools in the greater metropolitan area of Wuhan, China, completed an in-class self-administered questionnaire on their respiratory health and home environment.

RESULTS: Coal burning for cooking and/or heating increased odds of wheezing with colds [odds ratio (OR) = 1.57, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.07-2.29] and without colds (OR = 1.44, 95{\%} CI: 1.05-1.97). For smoking in the home, the strongest associations were seen for cough (OR = 1.74, 95{\%} CI: 1.17-2.60) and phlegm production (OR = 2.25, 95{\%} CI: 1.36-3.72) without colds among children who lived with two or more smokers.

CONCLUSIONS: Chinese children living with smokers or in coal-burning homes are at increased risk for respiratory impairment. While economic development in China may decrease coal burning by providing cleaner fuels for household energy use, the increasing prevalence of cigarette smoking is a growing public health concern due to its effects on children. Adverse effects of tobacco smoke exposure were seen despite the low rates of maternal smoking (3.6{\%}) in this population.},

abstract = {Groundwater reservoirs are important water resources all over the world. Especially, they are of utmost significance for arid and semi-arid regions, and therefore, a sustainable exploitation of these reservoirs needs to be ensured. The natural and most exclusive water supplier to groundwater reservoirs in Saudi Arabia is rainfall, which is characterized by sporadic and random temporal and spatial distributions, particularly under the impacts of climate change; giving rise to uncertainty in groundwater recharge quantification. Although in Saudi Arabia, intense and frequent rainfall events are rare, but they generate significant flash floods with huge amounts of surface water. Under such circumstances, any simple but effective water storage augmentation facility such as rainwater harvesting (RWH) structures gain vital importance for sustainability of water supply and survivals in arid and semi-arid regions. The objective of this study is to explore the possibility of RWH over a basin in the western province of Saudi Arabia called Wadi Al-Lith under climate change. Climatic data is obtained from the IPCC AR5 GCMs, which is further downscaled using a regional climate model RegCM4 for the Arabian Peninsula domain. The RegCM4 is driven to simulate climatic parameters including rainfall at 25 km grid resolution for the present climate (1971–2000), and future climate (2006–2099) with representative concentration pathways, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Results indicate that more durable and longer wet durations are expected with increasing surplus rainfall amounts in the far future because of climate change impacts. Consequently, future climate scenarios are expected to enhance floods and flash floods occurrences, which call for progressive measures to harness the RWH opportunity.},

@article{Ogden2000,
abstract = {On 28 July 1997, an unusually moist air mass, driven westward towards the foothills of the Rocky Mountains near Fort Collins, Colorado, produced torrential rainfall. The nearly saturated atmospheric column in conjunction with light upper-level winds resulted in a “warm rain” process convective storm with little net motion. On the evening of 28 July over 200 mm of rain fell in western Fort Collins. This extreme rainstorm was observed by three S-band weather radars, including two National Weather Service WSR-88D radars and the dual-polarization CSU-CHILL radar. Fourteen recording rain gages in and near the affected area recorded the event. The US Geological Survey, Colorado District, performed indirect peak discharge measurements. In our analysis, the two-dimensional, physically-based hydrologic model CASC2D is applied to examine the influence of rainfall and land surface data uncertainty on runoff predictions in the 25 km2 Spring Creek watershed. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity values are calibrated in simulations of the rise in nearby Horsetooth Reservoir. Results of simulations driven by polarimetric and single-polarization radar-rainfall estimates and recording rain gage data show that for this extreme event in an urbanized watershed, rainfall estimation errors give rise to the most significant errors in runoff predictions. Hydrologic simulations with various levels of land-surface detail reveal that uncertainty in watershed characteristics has a considerably smaller effect on runoff predictions than uncertainty in the space/time distribution of rainfall. The soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, fraction of impervious area, and the retention depth are the most sensitive land-surface parameters.},

abstract = {This study examines the characteristics of a large number of extreme rain events over the eastern two-thirds of the United States. Over a 5-yr period, 184 events are identified where the 24-h precipitation total at one or more stations exceeds the 50-yr recurrence amount for that location. Over the entire region of study, these events are most common in July. In the northern United States, extreme rain events are confined almost exclusively to the warm season; in the southern part of the country, these events are distributed more evenly throughout the year. National composite radar reflectivity data are used to classify each event as a mesoscale convective system (MCS), a synoptic system, or a tropical system, and then to classify the MCS and synoptic events into subclassifications based on their organizational structures. This analysis shows that 66{\%} of all the events and 74{\%} of the warm-season events are associated with MCSs; nearly all of the cool-season events are caused by storms with strong synoptic forcing. Similarly, nearly all of the extreme rain events in the northern part of the country are caused by MCSs; synoptic and tropical systems play a larger role in the South and East. MCS-related events are found to most commonly begin at around 1800 local standard time (LST), produce their peak rainfall between 2100 and 2300 LST, and dissipate or move out of the affected area by 0300 LST.},

There is agreement that advances in the past few decades over a broad front of understanding physical processes and in technology have not been comprehensively applied to weather modification. Such advances need to be capitalized upon in the form of a concerted and sustained national effort to carry out basic and applied research in weather modification. The need for credible scientific evidence and the pressure for action should be resolved. Differences in the perception of current knowledge, the utility of numerical models, and the specific needs of research and operations in weather modification must be addressed.

abstract = {The circulation of the ocean is usually divided into two parts, a wind-driven circulation that dominates in the upper few hundred meters, and a density-driven circulation that dominates below. The latter is called the ‘thermohaline' circulation because of the role of heating, cool- ing, freshening, and salinification in producing regional density differences within the ocean. The thermohaline circulation, for the most part, is an ‘overturning' circulation in which warm water flows poleward near the surface and is subsequently converted into cold water that sinks and flows equatorward in the in- terior. Radiocarbon measurements show that the thermohaline circulation turns over all the deep water in the ocean every 600 years or so},

This storm occurred on 18 February 2009 over a mountain in Wyoming. The numerical simulations use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model in LES mode with horizontal grid spacings of 300 and 100 m in a domain covering the entire mountain range, and a glaciogenic seeding parameterization coupled with the Thompson microphysics scheme. A series of non-LES simulations at 900-m resolution, each with different initial/boundary conditions, is validated against sounding, cloud, and precipitation data. The LES runs then are driven by the most representative 900-m non-LES simulation. The 100-m LES results compare reasonably well to the vertical-plane radar data.

abstract = {Documentation during January and February 2000 of the structure of severe convective storms in Mendoza, Argentina, with a cloud-physics jet aircraft penetrating the major feeder clouds from cloud base to the -45°C isotherm level is reported. Complementary radar, satellite, and radiosonde measurements are incorporated into the study. The main research goal was the description of the microphysical evolution of the convective feeders of the hailstorms from cloud base to the anvil in an attempt to gain insights into the microphysical evolution of the clouds that are associated with the high frequency of large hail in the region. The aircraft penetrated preferentially the tops of young growing elements, which were typically the major feeders to severe hailstorms, producing hail that is large ({\textgreater}3 cm) in size. Cloud bases typically were at 6°–14°C, with typical base updrafts of 4–7 m s-1. The cloud updrafts increased with height, exceeding 25 m s-1 at heights ≥7 km and, on occasion, 40 m s-1 at heights {\textgreater}8 km. Thermal buoyancies of 5°–8°C were measured in the convective towers at heights of 8–10 km. The vertical wind shear was weak below 6 km but increased strongly above that level as the west winds cleared the Andes barrier, which averages 6.1 km to the west of Mendoza. The clouds had very little coalescence and contained no detectable precipitation-sized particles {\textgreater}100 $\mu$m at temperatures {\textgreater}-15°C. Nearly adiabatic cloud water with most cloud water still not converted into precipitation-sized hydrometeors ({\textgreater}100 $\mu$m in diameter) was found in cloud filaments within the strongest updrafts up to the level of homogeneous freezing, reaching 4 g m-3 at -38°C in one cloud before vanishing abruptly at colder temperatures. Graupel {\textgreater}1 mm appeared at the tops of growing new towers at temperatures},

abstract = {In previous studies published in the open literature, a strong relationship between the occurrence of hail and the microwave brightness temperatures (primarily at 37 and 85. GHz) was documented. These studies were performed with the Nimbus-7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) and most recently, the Aqua Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) sensor. This led to climatologies of hail frequency from TMI and AMSR-E, however, limitations included geographical domain of the TMI sensor (35. S to 35. N) and the overpass time of the Aqua satellite (130. am/pm local time), both of which reduce an accurate mapping of hail events over the global domain and the full diurnal cycle. Nonetheless, these studies presented exciting, new applications for passive microwave sensors.NOAA and EUMETSAT have been operating the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-A and -B) and the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) on several operational satellites since 1998: NOAA-15 through NOAA-19; MetOp-A and -B. With multiple satellites in operation since 2000, the AMSU/MHS sensors provide near global coverage every 4. h, thus, offering a much larger time and temporal sampling than TRMM or AMSR-E. With similar observation frequencies near 30 and 85. GHz, one at 157. GHz, and additionally three at the 183. GHz water vapor band, the potential to detect strong convection associated with severe storms on a more comprehensive time and space scale exists.In this study, we develop a prototype AMSU-based hail detection algorithm through the use of collocated satellite and surface hail reports over the continental US for a 10-year period (2000-2009). Compared with the surface observations, the algorithm detects approximately 40{\%} of hail occurrences. The simple threshold algorithm is then used to generate a hail climatology based on all available AMSU observations during 2000-2011 that is stratified in several ways, including total hail occurrence by month (March through September), total annual, and over the diurnal cycle. Independent comparisons are made compared to similar data sets derived from other satellite, ground radar and surface reports. The algorithm was also applied to global land measurements for a single year and showed close agreement with other satellite based hail climatologies. Such a product could serve as a prototype for use with a future geostationary based microwave sensor such as NASA's proposed PATH mission.},

Arabia's agriculture and water supplies using climatic change scenarios
from GCMs (General Circulation Models) and related research. The
resulting assessment indicates that an increase in temperature and
decrease in precipitation could have a major negative impact on agriculture
and water supplies in Saudi Arabia. To find signs of climatic change
in Saudi Arabia a preliminaryassessment of systematic changes in
temperature and precipitation was made, based on the records of four
Saudi weather stations. The analysis of this data, which dates back
to 1961, shows no discernable signs of climatic change during the
study period. Such data is, however, limited both spatially and temporally
and cannot provide conclusive evidence to confirm climatic changes
projected by GCMs. Nevertheless, in the light of recent climatic
conditions and rapid population growth, Saudi decision-makers are
urged to adopt a `no regret' policy. Ideally, such a policy would
include measures to avoid future environmental or socioeconomic problems
that may occur in the event of significant climatic change.},

abstract = {Abstract All of the 0000 UTC soundings from the United States made during the year 1992 that have nonzero convective available potential energy (CAPE) are examined. Soundings are classified as being associated with nonsupercell thunderstorms, supercells without significant tornadoes, and supercells with significant tornadoes. This classification is made by attempting to pair, based on the low-level sounding winds, an upstream sounding with each occurrence of a significant tornado, large hail, and/or 10 or more cloud-to-ground lightning flashes. Severe weather wind parameters (mean shear, 0?6-km shear, storm-relative helicity, and storm-relative anvil-level flow) and CAPE parameters (total CAPE and CAPE in the lowest 3000 m with buoyancy) are shown to discriminate weakly between the environments of the three classified types of storms. Combined parameters (energy?helicity index and vorticity generation parameter) discriminate strongly between the environments. The height of the lifting condensation level also appears to be generally lower for supercells with significant tornadoes than those without. The causes for the very large false alarm rates in the tornadic/nontornadic supercell forecast, even with the best discriminators, are discussed.},

@article{Zhang2004,
abstract = {Based on the 1979?95 mean pentad reanalysis data from the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction, the climatological characteristics and physical mechanism of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) onset are investigated. Special focus is given to whether the ASM onset starts earlier over the Indochina Peninsula than over the South China Sea (SCS) and why the ASM is established the earliest over Southeast Asia. An examination of the composite thermodynamic and dynamic quantities confirms that the ASM onset commences earliest over the Indochina Peninsula, as highlighted by active convection and rainfall resulting from the convergence of southwesterly flow from the Bay of Bengal (BOB) vortex and easterly winds associated with the subtropical anticyclone over the SCS. Two other important characteristics not previously noted are also identified: the earliest reversal of meridional temperature gradient throughout the entire troposphere and the corresponding establishment of an easterly vertical wind shear, which are due to upper level warming caused by eddy (convective) transport of latent heat. These changes in the large-scale circulation suggest that, in addition to rainfall, a reversal in the planetary-scale circulation should be included in determining the timing of the ASM onset. With such a consideration, the climatological ASM onset occurs first over southeastern BOB and southwestern Indochina Peninsula in early May, and then advances northeastward to reach the SCS by the fourth pentad of May (16?20 May). The monsoon then covers the entire Southeast Asia region by the end of May. Subsequently, a similar onset process begins over the eastern Arabian Sea, India and western BOB, and the complete establishment of the ASM over India is accomplished in mid June. In the process of the onset of each ASM component, the reversal of the upper level planetary-scale circulation depends strongly on that of the meridional temperature gradient. Over the Indochina Peninsula, the seasonal transition of upper level temperature results from convection-induced diabatic heating, whereas over western Asia it is attributed to subsidence warming induced by the active ascending motion over the former region. The steady increase in surface sensible heating over the Indian subcontinent and the latent heating over the tropical Indian Ocean in April to early May appear to be the major impetus for the development of the cyclonic vortex over the BOB. A similar enhancement over the Arabian Peninsula and the surrounding regions is also identified to be crucial to the development of the so-called onset vortex over the Arabian Sea, and then ultimately to the ASM onset over India.

abstract = {Hail growth is studied in the Westplains, Colorado, storm for which a variety of observations were collected. Measurements from a triple-Doppler radar network and a penetrating aircraft are used to synthesize fields of liquid water content and three-dimensional, evolving air motion from which detailed hail growth trajectories are computed. Explicit treatment of the growth of hail embryos is sidestepped. Rather, for the purpose of the study a wide range of embryo sizes is assumed to exist over a broad region of the storm and the analysis examines which particles are predicted to grow and what their growth trajectories are. Sensitivity of individual trajectories to many parameter such as initial position, embryo size, and particle drag law, is found. However, the general results, including the following, are insensitive: the storm flow field is organized such that an efficient mechanism exists for transporting particles into the updraft; following growth of the embryo outside the large updraft, a single pass though the updraft is sufficient to account for hail of the observed maximum size (1.5- 2.0 cm); fall-out positions and growth times are consistent with the observations; growth takes place primarily between -10 and -25°C. A wide variety of interweaving trajectories is predicted. In general they conform to the supercell model of Browning and Foote, though several differences are noted. Hail apparently can grow in the storm from a wide range of initial positions, but the favorable initial region for the smaller and more numerous embryos that are expected to dominate the hail production is more restricted. The width of the updraft is found to be an important factor in limiting hail growth in the storm. Melting during fall-out is also significant. The present results are shown to be consistent with a generalized hailstorm model termed an open-cell simple-trajectory model. By this it is meant that (a) the embryo stage of growth occurs outside the large updraft in which (b) the hail itself grows by making a single traverse, as opposed to following several looping "trajectories. Evidence supporting the general importance of this mode of behavior of hailstorms is presented. Alternative theories using them concepts are also discussed.},

abstract = {Radar rainfall has received growing attention in the urban drainage community since its first appearance on an Urban Storm Drainage Conference in 1984. Still, operational applications of radar rainfall in urban hydrology is limited. The following aspects have to be considered for radar rainfall data use specifically in urban hydrology: the type of the radar, the application requirements on the radar data, the achievable radar data quality, forecast possibilities and limits. Quantitative applications of weather radar to urban hydrology are becoming more mature with better understanding of limitations and achievable accuracy. Research in the US and Europe has led to operational applications of radar to site-specific forecasting of floods and management of sewer overflow during wet weather. The uncertainties and methods for obtaining accurate rainfall measurements at high resolution and with areal extents consistent with urban catchments is a major focus of this article. Evaluation and improvement of quantitative precipitation measurements are described in this overview with specific research and operational examples of radar use in urban hydrology. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This study is based on a questionnaire sent to 39 European NHMSs of which thirty-three (85{\%}) responded. Currently, many European NHMSs are actively developing their severe thunderstorm forecast process and warning services with 26 (79{\%}) of respondent countries issuing severe thunderstorm warnings and 8 (24{\%}) issuing tornado warnings. Both warning criteria and methodologies used in the warning process vary from country to country. Lead-times range from 30??min to 96??h, indicating a range of different warning philosophies for each country. Major challenges toward improving the warning operations include obtaining observations of severe weather for real-time forecasting and post-event verification, educating forecasters, and having access to state-of-the-art forecaster workstations. An additional challenge is in communicating anticipated or ongoing severe thunderstorms, both internationally between NHMSs and nationally with media and emergency authorities. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Measurements using the 2-D video disdrometer (2DVD) taken during a heavy rainfall event in Huntsville, Alabama, are analysed. The 2DVD images were processed to derive the rain microstructure parameters for each individual drop, which in turn were used as input to the T-matrix method to compute the forward and back scatter amplitudes of each drop at C-band. The polarimetric radar variables were then calculated from the individual drop contribution over a finite time period, e.g., 1 min. The calculated co-polar reflectivity, differential reflectivity, specific differential propagation phase and the co-polar correlation coefficient were compared with measurements from a C-band polarimetric radar located 15 km away. An attenuation-correction method based on the specific differential propagation phase was applied to the co-polar and differential reflectivity data from the C-band radar, after ensuring accurate radar calibration. Time series comparisons of the parameters derived from the 2DVD and C-band radar data show very good agreement for all four quantities, the agreement being sometimes better than the computations using the 1-min drop size distribution and bulk assumptions on rain microstructure (such as mean shapes and model-based assumptions for drop orientation). The agreement is particularly improved in the case of co-polar correlation coefficient since this parameter is very sensitive to variation of shapes as well as orientation angles. The calculations mark the first attempt at utilizing experimentally derived "drop- by-drop" rain microstructure information to compute the radar polarimetric parameters and to demonstrate the value of utilizing the 2-D video disdrometer for studying rain microstructure under various precipitation conditions. Histograms of drop orientation angles as well as the most probable drop shapes and the corresponding variations were also derived and compared with prior results from the 80 m fall "artificial rain" experiment.},

Variables included teaching experience, sex, and self-ratings of the instructor, as well as course subject area. On the basis of equilibrium theory, a major hypothesis was that student ratings would produce changes in Ss who had rated themselves more favorably than their students had rated them. Results of a regression analysis generally support this hypothesis. A 2nd conclusion is that additional time (i.e., more than a half of a semester), along with comparative data to help the teacher interpret student feedback, also help to produce modest changes in teachers' instructional practices.},

abstract = {Between 1986 and 1992 a research project was developed and carried out on hail climatology and the economic repercussions of hail on agriculture in Leon (northwestern Spain). A target area with an extent of 6825 km2 was defined, within which a network of meteorological observers was established at an average density of 1 per 17 km2. A network of 250 hailpads installed in a grid formation was also laid out over an area of 1000 km2 inside the target area. The frequent occurrence of hailfalls - 122 hail days over seven consecutive summers - provided a detailed database and allowed several climatological studies to be made. Crop damage was also closely monitored and quantified. Barley and wheat were selected as crops on which to base an analysis of the relationship between hailfall characteristics and crop damage. As the resistance of plants to hailstones is held to vary according to their physiological state, four different stages of plant growth were defined, beginning with the formation of grain heads. An important conclusion was drawn: the dispersion of percentages of damage always covers the possible variations in resistance caused by the physiological state of the plants. As a result, using only minimal information about hailfall characteristics - namely, the initial reports of observers regarding hailstone size - a working statistical model has successfully been constructed to predict losses to barley and wheat, using data provided by the Le{\'{o}}n hail project.},

abstract = {A theoretical framework has been developed describing nonequilibrium formation and maintenance of mixed-phase clouds. The necessary and sufficient conditions required to activate liquid water within a preexisting ice cloud, and thus convert it to mixed phase, are considered for three scenarios: (i) uniform ascent, (ii) harmonic vertical oscillations, and (iii) turbulent fluctuations. The general conditions are the following: 1) First necessary condition: The vertical velocity of an ice cloud parcel must exceed a threshold velocity to activate liquid water. 2) Second necessary condition: The activation of liquid water within an ice cloud parcel, below water saturation, requires a vertical ascent above some threshold altitude to bring the vapor pressure of the parcel to water saturation. Only when the first and second conditions are true do these conditions become sufficient for the activation of liquid water in ice clouds. These required conditions for the generation of mixed-phase cloud are supported by parcel modeling results and analogous conditions for a harmonic oscillation concerning the amplitude and tangential velocity of the parcel motion are proposed. The authors do not assume steady-state conditions, but demonstrate that nonequilibrium evolution of cloud parcels can lead to long-term steady existence of mixed-phase cloud. -� 2008 American Meteorological Society},

in the earth's heat balance, but these forcings are space/time integrals

forcings will require an unprecedented synergy among satellite, airborne,

one aspect of achieving this synergy—the need to treat aerosol variability
in a consistent and realistic way. This need creates a requirement
to rationalize the differences in spatiotemporal resolution and coverage
among the various observational and modeling approaches. It is shown,
based on aerosol optical data from diverse regions, that mesoscale
variability (specifically, for horizontal scales of 40–400 km and
temporal scales of 2–48 h) is a common and perhaps universal feature
of lower-tropospheric aerosol light extinction. Such variation is
below the traditional synoptic or “airmass” scale (where the aerosol
is often assumed to be essentially homogeneous except for plumes
from point sources) and below the scales that are readily resolved
by chemical transport models. The present study focuses on documenting
this variability. Possible physical causes and practical implications
for coordinated observational strategies are also discussed.},

@article{Stevens1998,
abstract = {A variety of models of boundary layer turbulence are increasingly being coupled to binned representation of cloud-drop spectra for the purpose of studying cloudy boundary layers and aerosol-cloud-drop interactions. A critique of one dimensional models shows that extant methods of coupling bin-microphysical models to the turbulence model omit important terms involving covariances of perturbation quantities. Errors incurred from the omission of these terms are significant: cloud-drop activation is not properly represented, and the initial stages of precipitation growth may be retarded in horizontally inhomogeneous boundary layers. If the promise of one-dimensional models is ever to be realized, some means of accurately representing these terms must be developed. Because large-scale models often have grid-spacings much larger than typical cloud-eddy-scale circulations, attempts to couple them to more detailed microphysical representations will also suffer from the problems discussed in the context of one-dimensional models. This should provide added motivation for improving the representation of microphysical processes on the sub-grid scale. An analysis of two-dimensional eddy-resolving models closed on the basis of energy inertial range arguments illustrates that the lack of an energy cascade in two dimensions results in increasingly vigorous circulations as the model's grid-mesh is refined. Two-dimensional model simulations can display significant variability to vanishingly small differences in the initial conditions, and drizzle rates vary by as much as 30{\%} when total water concentrations are increased by only 1{\%}. Such sensitivities make it difficult to constrain the models given the degree of uncertainty that characterizes measurements of state variables in clouds. Despite some inconsistencies in the formulation of their closure terms, two-dimensional models are at least able to qualitatively represent the interaction of the large-eddies and microphysical processes in boundary layer flows. For this reason they appear to be useful, not as surrogates for reality, but rather as a means for further refining hypotheses about the physical system thereby increasing the chances that such hypotheses can be tested observationally.},

The results show that the strongest effects of introducing giant CCN occur when the background concentration of small nuclei is high, as that in continental clouds. Under these conditions, the coalescence between water drops is enhanced due to the inclusion of giant CCN, resulting in an early development of large drops at the lower parts of the clouds. It also leads to the formation of larger graupel particles and to more intensive radar reflectivities. When the background concentration of small nuclei is low, as in maritime clouds, the effect of the giant CCN is smaller and the development of precipitation is dominated by the droplets formed on large nuclei.},

abstract = {BackgroundGlobal Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 results show continued limitations of data quality and availability in most of the African region. Focused efforts in South Africa, however, have contributed to improved completeness and availability of mortality data, such that South Africa is currently undertaking a second National Burden of Disease Study. Mortality estimates have been developed nationally and for the nine provinces for 1997—2009.
MethodsVital registration data obtained for 1997—2009 were adjusted for completeness using indirect demographic techniques. A regression approach was used to identify misclassified AIDS deaths, and garbage codes were proportionally redistributed by age, sex, and population group. Injury deaths were estimated from additional data sources. Age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) trends for the nine provinces were calculated using ASSA 2008 population estimates and the WHO age standard.
FindingsAll-cause mortality peaked in 2006 and thereafter started to decline. ASMRs showed a two-fold difference between the highest-affected and lowest-affected provinces for the 1997—2009 period. ASMR from HIV/AIDS increased threefold since 1997 with provincial variation, while mortality from non-HIV-related tuberculosis declined. Mortality rates from non-communicable diseases decreased over the period nationally but increased for some provinces and remained stable for others as a result of differing trends in hypertensive heart disease and respiratory diseases. Nationally, preliminary analyses for 2009 show that HIV/AIDS was responsible for the highest number of deaths (31{\textperiodcentered}2{\%}; n=194 322 of 622 300 deaths), followed by cerebrovascular disease (6{\textperiodcentered}2{\%}; n=38 666), tuberculosis (5{\textperiodcentered}4{\%}; n=33 375), lower respiratory infections (5{\textperiodcentered}2{\%}; n=32 568), and ischaemic heart disease (4{\textperiodcentered}4{\%}; n=27 688). However, tuberculosis and interpersonal violence ranked among the top five causes for males, while hypertensive heart disease and ischaemic heart disease featured for females.
InterpretationThe downward trend in HIV/AIDS mortality can be attributed to the extensive antiretroviral treatment rollout since 2005. Differential provincial mortality trends reflect the different stages of epidemiological transition and differential health services in the provinces, providing relevant information for policy makers to address inequalities.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantification of the disease burden caused by different risks informs prevention by providing an account of health loss different to that provided by a disease-by-disease analysis. No complete revision of global disease burden caused by risk factors has been done since a comparative risk assessment in 2000, and no previous analysis has assessed changes in burden attributable to risk factors over time. METHODS: We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; sum of years lived with disability [YLD] and years of life lost [YLL]) attributable to the independent effects of 67 risk factors and clusters of risk factors for 21 regions in 1990 and 2010. We estimated exposure distributions for each year, region, sex, and age group, and relative risks per unit of exposure by systematically reviewing and synthesising published and unpublished data. We used these estimates, together with estimates of cause-specific deaths and DALYs from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, to calculate the burden attributable to each risk factor exposure compared with the theoretical-minimum-risk exposure. We incorporated uncertainty in disease burden, relative risks, and exposures into our estimates of attributable burden. FINDINGS: In 2010, the three leading risk factors for global disease burden were high blood pressure (7{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} [95{\%} uncertainty interval 6{\textperiodcentered}2-7{\textperiodcentered}7] of global DALYs), tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} [5{\textperiodcentered}5-7{\textperiodcentered}0]), and alcohol use (5{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} [5{\textperiodcentered}0-5{\textperiodcentered}9]). In 1990, the leading risks were childhood underweight (7{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} [6{\textperiodcentered}8-9{\textperiodcentered}4]), household air pollution from solid fuels (HAP; 7{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} [5{\textperiodcentered}6-8{\textperiodcentered}3]), and tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} [5{\textperiodcentered}4-6{\textperiodcentered}8]). Dietary risk factors and physical inactivity collectively accounted for 10{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (95{\%} UI 9{\textperiodcentered}2-10{\textperiodcentered}8) of global DALYs in 2010, with the most prominent dietary risks being diets low in fruits and those high in sodium. Several risks that primarily affect childhood communicable diseases, including unimproved water and sanitation and childhood micronutrient deficiencies, fell in rank between 1990 and 2010, with unimproved water and sanitation accounting for 0{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (0{\textperiodcentered}4-1{\textperiodcentered}6) of global DALYs in 2010. However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa childhood underweight, HAP, and non-exclusive and discontinued breastfeeding were the leading risks in 2010, while HAP was the leading risk in south Asia. The leading risk factor in Eastern Europe, most of Latin America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa in 2010 was alcohol use; in most of Asia, North Africa and Middle East, and central Europe it was high blood pressure. Despite declines, tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke remained the leading risk in high-income north America and western Europe. High body-mass index has increased globally and it is the leading risk in Australasia and southern Latin America, and also ranks high in other high-income regions, North Africa and Middle East, and Oceania. INTERPRETATION: Worldwide, the contribution of different risk factors to disease burden has changed substantially, with a shift away from risks for communicable diseases in children towards those for non-communicable diseases in adults. These changes are related to the ageing population, decreased mortality among children younger than 5 years, changes in cause-of-death composition, and changes in risk factor exposures. New evidence has led to changes in the magnitude of key risks including unimproved water and sanitation, vitamin A and zinc deficiencies, and ambient particulate matter pollution. The extent to which the epidemiological shift has occurred and what the leading risks currently are varies greatly across regions. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risks are still those associated with poverty and those that affect children. FUNDING: Bill {\&} Melinda Gates Foundation.},

may cause the 8.6um sulfur dioxide ({\{}SO2{\}}) retrieval to overestimate
total column abundances and contribute to variations between ultraviolet

model which allows the determination of transmission spectra. The
forward model is embedded into a three-layer atmospheric radiative
transfer model, based upon the moderate spectral resolution atmospheric
transmittance algorithm (MODTRAN) radiative transfer code. This model
is used to investigate the effects of silicate ash on the 8.6um SO2
retrieval from satellite data. Forward modeling of transmission through
volcanic clouds enables us to evaluate the assumptions and errors
of current retrievals. Four free variables, (1) effective radius,
(2) variance, (3) number of particles, and (4) spectral refractive
index, are used to determine the transmission and single scattering
albedo at ?. Here we present simplistic characterizations of three
eruptions, containing sulfates, ice, or andesitic ash using this
forward model. The ash correction model based on the aerosol forward
model is tested on the ash-rich lobe of the 19 February 2001 eruption
plume of Mount Cleveland volcano using Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Uncorrected MODIS radiance values
estimate 22 kt of SO2, while ash-corrected radiances estimate 17
kt. The minimal reduction in total SO2 indicates that previous variations
in ultraviolet and 8.6? SO2 retrievals are unlikely to be due solely
to the presence of ash.},

abstract = {Sounding parameters are examined to determine whether they can help distinguish between Alberta, Canada, severe thunderstorms that spawn significant tornadoes (F2–F4), weak tornadoes (F0–F1), or non- tornadic severe storms producing large hail. Parameters investigated included storm-relative helicity (SRH), precipitable water (PW), and storm convergence. The motivation for analyzing these parameters is that, in theory, they might affect the rate of change of vertical vorticity generation through vortex stretching, vortex tilting, and baroclinic effects. Precipitable water showed statistically significant differences between signifi- cant tornadic storms and those severe storms that produced weak tornadoes or no tornadoes. All significant tornadic cases in the dataset used had PW values exceeding 22 mm, with a median value of 24 mm. Values of PW between 19 and 23 mm were generally associated with weak tornadic storms. Computed values of storm convergence, height of the lifted condensation level, and normalized most unstable CAPE did not discriminate between any of the three storm categories. The SRH showed discrimination of significant tornadoes from both weak tornadic and nontornadic severe storm groups. The Alberta data suggest that significant tornadoes tended to occur with SRH{\textgreater}150m2 s-2 computed for the 0–3-km layer whereas weak tornadoes were typically formed for values between 30 and 150m2 s-2. Threshold values of SRH were lower than those suggested in studies based on storm observations throughout much of the United States.},

The overflights were at a nominal altitude of 33 m. Wind and air temperature sensors were at 10 m on two National Data Buoy Office (NDBO) buoys and at 3.5 m on two Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) buoys. The buoy wind speeds were adjusted to the aircraft altitude using diabatic flux-profile relations and bulk aerodynamic formulas to estimate the surface fluxes and stability. For the experimental period (22 April-23 May 1981) and location (northern coast of California), the atmospheric surface layer was generally stable, with the Monin-Obukhov length on average 500 m with large variability. The results of the intercomparisons of the above variables were in general good. Average differences (aircraft - buoy) and standard deviations were +0.1 m s−1 (±1.8) for wind speed, 3.3 deg (±11.2) for wind ...},

abstract = {Meteorological fields are required inputs for air-quality models, but they can contain significant errors which contribute to uncertainties in simulations of airborne chemical species, aerosols and particulate matter. Atmospheric states can be diagnosed from observations or simulated by dynamical models (with or without four-dimensional data assimilation, FDDA). In general, diagnostic models are straightforward to operate, but obtaining sufficient observations to analyze regional-scale features is costly, may omit key variables and often lack sufficient spatial or temporal density to describe the fields adequately. Dynamical models, although still imperfect, have improved in recent years and are now widely accepted for many air-quality modeling applications. Examination of the current state of dynamical models used as meteorological pre-processors indicates that useful simulations for real cases are feasible for scales at least as fine as 1km. Introduction of faster computers and practical FDDA techniques already allow simulations of regional episodes lasting up to 5-10d with fine resolutions (5km or less). As technology has improved, however, a need has developed for better parameterizations to represent vital physical processes, such as boundary layer fluxes, deep convection and clouds, at these finer grid scales. Future developments in meteorological modeling for air-quality applications will include advanced model physics and data assimilation, better coupling between meterological and chemical models, and could lead eventually to widespread use of fully integrated meteorological-chemical models for simulating and predicting air quality.

A set of analyses is presented for both methods whereby the sensitivity to the radius of inclusion, the regression time window, the regression time offset, and the number of stations used to make the estimates are examined.

abstract = {A study is presented focusing on the potential value of parameters derived from radiosonde data or data from numerical atmospheric models for the forecasting of severe weather associated with convective storms. Parameters have been derived from soundings in the proximity of large hail, tornadoes (including tornadoes over water: waterspouts) and thunderstorms in the Netherlands. 66,365 radiosonde soundings from six stations in and around the Netherlands between 1 Dec. 1975 to 31 Aug. 2003 were classified as being associated or not associated with these weather phenomena using observational data from voluntary observers, the Dutch National Meteorological Institute (KNMI) and lightning data from the U.K. Met. Office. It was found that instability as measured by the Lifted Index or CAPE and 0-6??km wind shear independently have considerable skill in distinguishing environments of large hail and of non-hail-producing thunderstorms. It was also found that CAPE released below 3??km above ground level is on average high near waterspouts and weak tornadoes that mostly occur with low shear in the lowest 1??km above the Earth's surface. On the other hand, low-level shear is strong in environments of stronger (F1 and F2) tornadoes and increases with increasing F-scale. This is consistent with the notion that stretching of pre-existing vertical vorticity is the most important mechanism for the formation of weak tornadoes while the tilting of vorticity is more important with stronger tornadoes. The presented results may assist forecasters to assess the likelihood of severe hail or tornadoes. ?? 2006.},

The maximum errors in the radial speeds, based on the apparent speed of the ground strikes, was found to have a magnitude of less than 2.0 m s−1. These errors appear to have a slowly varying systematic part and a random part. The tidal radial speeds were corrected for running averages of these errors resulting in a random residual error of less than 0.3 m s−1 in magnitude. Data are considered usable for those range bins in which the return signal amplitude exceeds that of the average shot noise by two times the rms variation in the noise. These data were analyzed to produce wind vectors on a geographic grid divided into 1 kilometer square cells. The resulting wind field appears to be very realistic and contains features similar to those apparent in ground level wind observations. T...},

Wood fuel burning produced the highest emission of 18 PAH and 11 genotoxic PAH in terms of the emission factor on energy basis (mg/MJ), emission rate, and pollutant concentration in smoke, while the charcoal produced the least. On a fuel-weight basis, wood fuel produced almost the same emission factor of the total of 18 PAH (110 mg/kg) as coal briquettes but twice as much as genotoxic PAH, 13.4 vs 6.5 mg/kg. The wood fuel high burning rate, however, resulted in the highest total 18 PAH emission rate (208 mg/h) and concentration (957 ?g/m3), leading to a high exposure to toxic pollutants. The PM emission factor in milligrams per kilogram of fuel was 51, 36, and 7 for the wood, charcoal, and coal briquettes, respectively. The largest fraction of PAH in PM was found for wood fuel burning smoke. The average daily cooking of a household of 2?3 releases 40 mg of genotoxic PAH from wood fuel, 9 mg from coal briquettes, and 3.3 mg from charcoal burning.

abstract = {This study aims to determine the climatology of cloudiness over the Arabian Peninsula. The determined climatology will assist solar energy resource assessment in the region. The seasonality of cloudiness and its spatial variability will also help guide several cloud seeding operational experiments in the region. Cloud properties from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) database covering the time period from 1983 through 2009 are analyzed. Time series of low, medium, high, and total cloud amounts are investigated, in addition to cloud optical depth and total column water vapor. Initial results show significant decreasing trends in the total and middle cloud amounts, both annually and seasonally, at a 95{\%} confidence interval. The relationship between cloud amounts and climate oscillations known to affect the region is explored. Climate indices exhibiting significant correlations with the total cloud amounts include the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index. The study also includes a focus on the United Arab Emirates (UAE), comparing the inferred cloudiness data to in situ rainfall measurements taken from rain gauges across the UAE. To assess the impact of cloudiness on solar power resources in the country, time series of cloud amounts and Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI), obtained from the UAE Solar Atlas, are compared.},

@article{Flossmann2010,
abstract = {This review compiles the main results obtained using a mesoscale cloud model with bin resolved cloud micophysics and aerosol particle scavenging, as developed by our group over the years and applied to the simulation of shallow and deep convective clouds. The main features of the model are reviewed in different dynamical frameworks covering parcel model dynamics, as well as 1.5D, 2D and 3D dynamics. The main findings are summarized to yield a digested presentation which completes the general understanding of cloud-aerosol interaction, as currently available from textbook knowledge. Furthermore, it should provide support for general cloud model development, as it will suggest potentially minor processes that might be neglected with respect to more important ones and can support development of parameterizations for air quality, chemical transport and climate models.Our work has shown that in order to analyse dedicated campaign results, the supersaturation field and the complex dynamics of the specific clouds needs to be reproduced. Only 3D dynamics represents the variation of the supersaturation over the entire cloud, the continuous nucleation and deactivation of hydrometeors, and the dependence upon initial particle size distribution and solubility.However, general statements on certain processes can be obtained also by simpler dynamics. In particular, we found:. Nucleation incorporates about 90{\%} of the initial aerosol particle mass inside the cloud drops. Collision and coalescence redistributes the scavenged aerosol particle mass in such a way that the particle mass follows the main water mass. Small drops are more polluted than larger ones, as pollutant mass mixing ratio decreases with drops size. Collision and coalescence mixes the chemical composition of the generated drops. Their complete evaporation will release processed particles that are mostly larger and more hygroscopic than the initial particles. An interstitial aerosol is left unactivated between the cloud drops which is reduced in number and almost devoid of large particles. Consequently, impaction scavenging can probably be neglected inside clouds. Below clouds, impaction scavenging contributes around 30{\%} to the particle mass reaching the ground by a rainfall event. The exact amount depends on the precise case studied. Nucleation and impaction scavenging directly by the ice phase in mixed phase clouds seems to play a minor role with respect to the particle mass that enters the ice particles via freezing of the liquid phase.The aerosol scavenging efficiency generally follows rather closely the precipitation scavenging value. The nucleation scavenging efficiency is around 90{\%} for the liquid phase clouds and impaction scavenging generally contributed to about 30{\%} of the particle mass in the rain. Clouds are very efficient in pumping up the boundary layer aerosol which essentially determines the cloud properties. For a marine case studied the net pumping depleted about 70{\%} of the aerosol from the section of the boundary layer considered. The larger particles (and thus 70{\%} of the mass vented up) got activated inside the cloud. A weak net import through cloud top and the upwind side was found, as well as a larger net export at the downwind side. The outside cloud subsidence can add to the replenishment of the boundary layer and eventually cause a recycling of the particles into the cloud.The results of the parcel model studies seem to indicate that increasing particulate pollution and decreasing solubility suppresses rain formation. In individual and short time cloud simulations this behaviour was even confirmed in our 3D model studies. However, taking into account entire cloud fields over longer periods of time yields the strong spatial and temporal variability of the results with isolated regions of inverse correlation of the effects. Even though in general initially the expected behaviour was found, after several hours of simulation, the overall precipitation amounts of the more polluted cases caught up. This suggests that a changing pollution will affect the spatial and temporal pattern of precipitation, but will probably not reduce the overall long term precipitation amount which might be entirely governed by the moisture state of the atmosphere. Our results regarding mixed phase precipitation with respect to "all liquid" cases seem to confirm this idea, as with increasing modelling time the precipitation mass of both cases also become similar. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Measurements of the aerosol total light scattering coefficient, asp, and the aerosol hemispheric backscatter ratio, p(1), as functions of relative humidity (RH in (so-called humidographs) at three wavelengths (450,550, and 700 nm) were obtained in the dry season in southern Africa (1) in ambient air in South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia, (2) at various distances downwind in identifiable smoke plumes from biomass fires, and (3) along the southwest coast of Africa. The ratio of sigma(sub sp) at an RH of 80{\%} to that at 30{\%} provides a measure of the effects of RH on sigma(sub sp), and similarly for Beta(1). For the three broad sampling categories given above, and at a wavelength of 550 nm, these ratios varied from 1.42 0.05 to 2.07 0.03 for sigma(sub sp), and from 0.69 0.05 to 0.99 0.14 for Beta(1). In general, humidographs for the ambient air samples showed a greater dependence on RH than those for smoke from identifiable biomass fires. During a period when dense, aged smoke was transported to the region from the north, the humidographs for sigma(sub sp) for ambient air samples were similar to those for identifiable smoke plume samples just approximately 10- to 50-min old. This suggests that as far as the effects of RH on sigma(sub sp) are concerned the effects of aging of smoke and its mixing with ambient air are realized within less than about an hour.},

The transport fields are then combined to show both horizontal and vertical transport of air to and from Pretoria at the different levels. Air transport patterns in the vertical are linked to the occurrence of absolutely stable layers which are also evident in the 16 ozonesonde profiles recorded at Pretoria during SAFARI. The coherence of the stratification based on dynamical and ozone analysis permits the use of mean ozone profiles with air volume fluxes to interpret the ozone in terms of photochemistry and transport within stable layers. Extensive recirculation across the meridional plane at Pretoria implies that advection of ozone is slow and that photochemistry is responsible for the observed vertical structure over central southern Africa in September and October 1992. Requisite ozone formation rates are supported by model analysis of ozone and ozone precursors measured from SAFARI and Transport and Atmospheric Research Chemistry near the Equator-Atlantic aircraft.},

The IFC method corrects the potential drift of the sensor offset at zero relative humidity, which is the critical parameter in determining the uncertainty of the measurements. The sensor offset is determined from the measurements themselves as obtained during periods when the aircraft is flying in the lower stratosphere at or above the hygropause, where the H2O mixing ratio reaches well-defined minimum values of about 5 ppmv and the contribution of atmospheric H2O to the sensor signal is minimal. The selection of stratospheric data is achieved with the help of potential temperature, which can be calculated in situ from measured temperature and pressure. The IFC method is capable of providing humidity measurements in near–real time with an uncertainty of ±8{\%} RH at the surface and ±7{\%} RH in the...},

@article{Wang2008,
abstract = {This paper describes the cubic spline–based operational system for the generation of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 1-min rain-rate product 2A-56 from tipping-bucket (TB) gauge measurements. A simulated TB gauge from a Joss–Waldvogel disdrometer is employed to evaluate the errors of the TB rain-rate estimation. These errors are very sensitive to the time scale of rain rates. One-minute rain rates suffer substantial errors, especially at low rain rates. When 1-min rain rates are averaged over 4–7-min intervals or longer, the errors dramatically reduce. Estimated lower rain rates are sensitive to the event definition whereas the higher rates are not. The median relative absolute errors are about 22{\%} and 32{\%} for 1-min rain rates higher and lower than 3 mm h-1, respectively. These errors decrease to 5{\%} and 14{\%} when rain rates are used at the 7-min scale. The radar reflectivity–rain-rate distributions drawn from the large amount of 7-min rain rates and radar reflectivity data are mostly insensitive to the event definition. The time shift due to inaccurate clocks can also cause rain-rate estimation errors, which increase with the shifted time length. Finally, some recommendations are proposed for possible improvements of rainfall measurements and rain-rate estimations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] },

The parameters determining the major features of the trajectories are the fuselage radius and a generalized Stokes number that can be used to calculate an equivalent water drop size for particles of arbitrary shape and density. As for water drops, the maximum width of the shadow zone for sampling the particles is about one-fifth of the fuselage radius, and it occurs for those in columns and plates of typical densities whose major dimensions are about 600 $\mu$m and 2 mm, respectively.},

abstract = {Assessments of human health impacts associated with outdoor air pollution often use air quality models to represent exposure, but involve uncertainties due to coarse model resolution. Here we quantify how estimates of mortality in the United States attributable to ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at coarse resolution differ from those at finer resolution. Using the finest modeled concentrations (12 km), we estimate that 66,000 (95{\%} CI, 39,300 - 84,500) all-cause and 21,400 (5,600 - 34,200) respiratory deaths per year are attributable to PM2.5 and O3 concentrations above low-concentration thresholds, respectively. Using model results at 36 km resolution gives mortality burdens that are 11{\%} higher for PM2.5 and 12{\%} higher for O3 than the 12 km estimates, suggesting a modest positive bias. We also scale modeled concentrations at 12 km to coarser resolutions by simple averaging, and repeat the mortality assessment at multiple resolutions from 24 to 408 km, including the resolutions of global models; in doing so, we account for the effect of resolution on population exposure. Coarse grid resolutions produce mortality estimates that are substantially biased low for PM2.5 (30-40{\%} lower than the 12 km estimate at {\textgreater}250 km resolution), but less than 6{\%} higher for O3 at any resolution. Mortality estimates for primary PM2.5 species show greater bias at coarse resolution than secondary species. These results suggest that coarse resolution global models ({\textgreater}100 km) are likely biased low for PM2.5 health effects. For ozone, biases due to coarse resolution may be much smaller, and the effect on modeled chemistry likely dominates.},

abstract = {Information on fatalities in India as a result of lightning flashes has been extracted from a database on disastrous weather events of the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Records dating from 1979 to 2011 indicate that about 5259 persons have been killed by lightning strikes in India. The maximum number of lightning fatalities was observed in the states of Maharashtra (29{\%}), West Bengal (12{\%}) and Uttar Pradesh (9{\%}). The spatial variation shows that lightning fatalities are higher over west central India. A significant number of males (89{\%}) have been killed by lightning flashes compared to females (5{\%}) and children (6{\%}) in India, which is most likely due to the larger proportion of males working and moving outdoors in lonely conditions. The overall fatality rate is about 0.25 per million population per year in India. The lightning fatalities are significantly more common in the rainy and the summer seasons. Comparisons were also made between the results of the present study and similar studies carried out in different parts of the world. Therefore, this study provides useful information on the risky lightning time in India to indicate a public awareness and lightning safety campaign.},

In this study we presents the potentiality of retrieving concentrations of particulate matter with diameters less than ten micrometer (PM10) in the atmosphere using the Landsat 7 ETM+ slc-off satellite images over Makkah, Mina and Arafah. A multispectral algorithm is developed by assuming that surface condition of study area are lambertian and homogeneous. In situ PM10 measurements were collected using DustTrak aerosol monitor 8520 and their locations were determined by a handheld global positioning system (GPS). The multispectral algorithm model shows that PM10 high during Hajj season compared to other season. The retrieval dataset gives the accuracy {\textgreater} 0.8 of R coefficient value over Makkah, Mina and Arafah. These results provide confidence that the multispectral algorithm PM10 models can make accurate predictions of the concentrations of PM10.},

Surface observations of daily maximum and minimum temperatures from high-quality datasets at 27 stations are used as the input. The trend throughout each season is then derived by employing Sen's slope estimator to four extreme value indices, four relative indices and three mean value indices. Warming trends for extreme value indices are observed for the majority of stations, particularly significant (at 95{\%} level) in spring and summer seasons, however, mixed increase/decrease trends are found for the cold temperature extremes in autumn and winter seasons. Relative indices show significant warming trends for the majority of stations in all seasons; however, strongwarming (above 5 days decade−1) iswitnessed in the spring, summer and autumn seasons. The rapid rise (fall) of the number of warm (cool) days compared to warm (cool) nights is observed in the winter, summer and autumn (winter and spring) seasons.Warming of cool/warm nights is insignificant for the majority of stations in winter. The national average of mean value index diurnal temperature range shows an increasing trend for all seasons; however, its mixed increase/decrease trends are observed for the majority of stations in summer and autumn seasons. Time series analysis reveals that irrespective of seasons, warming is clearly visible in Saudi Arabia after 1997. Variations of warming for different regions across the country are also noticed.},

The data originated from two almost-collocated radars in central Oklahoma. To avoid biases in estimates, the slopes with respect to range of differences in reflectivities and differential reflectivities are assumed to represent the specific attenuations. Observations on a day with no reports of hail on the ground and on a day with large hail are contrasted. A simple one-dimensional model of melting hail is used to qualify these observations. Examples of volumetric fields of the polarimetric variables obtained at the two wavelengths are presented to illustrate that much can be learned about size, orientation, and phase of hydrometeors over volumes that play a role in precipitation formation.},

Annual mean PM2.5 levels have historically remained below 8$\mu$g/m3 while warm season (November-March) ozone levels occasionally exceed the Australian guideline value of 0.10ppm (daily 1h max). Yet, these levels are still below those seen in the United States and Europe. This analysis focuses on two related questions: (1) what is the public health burden associated with air pollution in Sydney; and (2) to what extent would reducing air pollution reduce the number of hospital admissions, premature deaths and number of years of life lost (YLL)? We addressed these questions by applying a damage function approach to Sydney population, health, PM2.5 and ozone data for 2007 within the BenMAP-CE software tool to estimate health impacts and economic benefits. We found that 430 premature deaths (90{\%} CI: 310-540) and 5800 YLL (95{\%} CI: 3900-7600) are attributable to 2007 levels of PM2.5 (about 2{\%} of total deaths and 1.8{\%} of YLL in 2007). We also estimate about 630 (95{\%} CI: 410-840) respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions attributable to 2007 PM2.5 and ozone exposures. Reducing air pollution levels by even a small amount will yield a range of health benefits. Reducing 2007 PM2.5 exposure in Sydney by 10{\%} would, over 10 years, result in about 650 (95{\%} CI: 430-850) fewer premature deaths, a gain of 3500 (95{\%} CI: 2300-4600) life-years and about 700 (95{\%} CI: 450-930) fewer respiratory and cardiovascular hospital visits. These results suggest that substantial health benefits are attainable in Sydney with even modest reductions in air pollution.},

abstract = {Abstract Intercomparisons of meteorological data—wind speed and direction, surface temperature and surface pressure—were obtained for NCAR Queen Air overflights of four buoys during the CODE-1 experiment. The overflights were at a nominal altitude of 33 m. Wind and air temperature sensors were at 10 m on two National Data Buoy Office (NDBO) buoys and at 3.5 m on two Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) buoys. The buoy wind speeds were adjusted to the aircraft altitude using diabatic flux-profile relations and bulk aerodynamic formulas to estimate the surface fluxes and stability. For the experimental period (22 April-23 May 1981) and location (northern coast of California), the atmospheric surface layer was generally stable, with the Monin-Obukhov length on average 500 m with large variability. The results of the intercomparisons of the above variables were in general good. Average differences (aircraft - buoy) and standard deviations were +0.1 m s−1 (±1.8) for wind speed, 3.3 deg (±11.2) for wind ...},

@article{Mbembe2003,
abstract = {This essay assumes that the ultimate expression of sovereignty resides, to a large degree, in the power and the capacity to dictate who may live and who must die. Hence, to kill or to allow to live constitute the limits of sovereignty, its fundamental attributes. To exercise sovereignty is to exercise control over mortality and to define life as the deployment and manifestation of power. One could summarize in the above terms what Michel Foucault meant by biopower: that domain of life over which power has taken control. But under what practical conditions is the right to kill, to allow to live, or to expose to death exercised? Who is the subject of this right? What does the implementation of such a right tell us about the person who is thus put to death and about the relation of enmity that sets that person against his or her murderer? Is the notion of biopower sufficient to account for the contemporary ways in which the political, under the guise of war, of resistance, or of the fight against terror, makes the murder of the enemy its primary and absolute objective? War, after all, is as much a means of achieving sovereignty as a way of exercising the right to kill. Imagining politics as a form of war, we must ask: What place is given to life, death, and the human body (in particular the wounded or slain body)? How are they inscribed in the order of power?},

@article{schultz_1993,
abstract = {In a 1-year field study, particle deposition flux was measured by
transparent collection plates. Particle concentration was simultaneously
measured with a cascade impactor. Microscopic evaluation of deposition
samples provided the discrimination of translucent (mineral or biological)
and black carbon particles, i.e. soot agglomerates, fly-ash cenospheres
and rubber fragments in the size range from 3 to 50 {\^{I}}¼m. The deposition
samples were collected in two different sampling devices. A wind-
and rain-shielded measurement was achieved in the Sigma-2 device.
Dry deposition data from this device were used to calculate mass
concentrations of the translucent and the black particle fraction
separately, approximating particle deposition velocity by Stokes'
settling velocity. In mass calculations an error up to 20{\%} has to
be considered due to assumed spherical shape and unit density for
all particles. Within the limitations of these assumptions, deposition
velocities of the distinguished coarse particles were calculated.
The results for total particulate matter in this range are in good
agreement with those from impactor measurement. The coarse black
carbon fraction shows a reduced deposition velocity in comparison
with translucent particles. The deviation depends on precipitation
amount. Further measurements and structural investigations of black
carbon particles are in preparation to verify these results.},

abstract = {Fluxes of CO2 are important for our understanding of the global carbon cycle and greenhouse gas balances. Several significant CO2 fluxes in nature may still be unknown as illustrated by recent findings of high CO2 emissions from aquatic environments, previously not recognized in global carbon balances. Therefore, it is important to develop convenient and affordable ways to measure CO2 in many types of environments. At present, direct measurements of CO2 fluxes from soil or water, or CO2 concentrations in surface water, are typically labor intensive or require costly equipment. We here present an approach with measurement units based on small inexpensive CO2 loggers, originally made for indoor air quality monitoring, that were tested and adapted for field use. Measurements of soil–atmosphere and lake–atmosphere fluxes, as well as of spatiotemporal dynamics of water CO2 concentrations (expressed as the equivalent partial pressure, pCO2aq) in lakes and a stream network are provided as examples. Results from all these examples indicate that this approach can provide a cost- and labor-efficient alternative for direct measurements and monitoring of CO2 flux and pCO2aq in terrestrial and aquatic environments.},

Developed to complement the existing gauge-based bias correction procedures used in the National Weather Service (NWS), the proposed procedure is a generalized local bias estimator that may be used under varying conditions of rain gauge network density and types of rainfall. To arrive at the procedure, the correction problem is formulated as a space–time estimation of radar and bin-averaged gauge rainfall from radar rainfall data and rain gauge measurements, respectively, at all hours up to and including the current hour. The estimation problem is then solved suboptimally via a variant of exponential smoothing. To evaluate the procedure, parameter estimation and true validation were performed using hourly radar-rainfall and rain gauge data from the Arkansas–Red Basin River Forecast Center (ABRFC) area. The results indicate that the proposed procedure is generally su...},

abstract = {The diurnal cycle of deep convection in the convectively active phase
(CAP) and convectively suppressed phase (CSP) of the Madden-Julian
Oscillation (MJO) was investigated using global infrared-equivalent
blackbody temperature (TBB) data from October 2000 to April 2005.
We particularly focused on super clusters (SCs) that occurred during
the CAP of the MJO. To analyze the behavior of SCs and the CSP of
the MJO statistically, we created composites of TBB for each case.
Four regions were examined: (1) the Indian Ocean (IO), (2) the ocean
area of the Maritime Continent (MCO), (3) the land area of the Maritime
Continent (MCL), and (4) the western Pacific (WP). The amplitude
(phase) of the diurnal cycle of deeper convection in SCs was larger
than (similar to) that of the CSP of the MJO. This result is consistent
with that found in a previous study. However, the diurnal cycle of
deep convection in the CSP of the MJO had a clear maximum peak, especially
over the MCL, but that in SCs had a broader maximum peak of deep
convection, especially in oceanic regions, although the diurnal phase
was similar between SCs and the CSP of the MJO. This result statistically
suggests that the organization of a convective system affects the
diurnal cycle of its deep convection, as described in a previous
case study. We also demonstrated that the difference in the diurnal
cycle of deep convection in the IO and WP regions arose from sea
surface temperature differences in those regions.},

abstract = {Hailstorms represent one of the major sources of damage and insurance loss to residential, commercial, and agricultural assets in several parts of Central Europe. However, there is little knowledge of hail risk across Europe beyond local historical damage reports due to the relative rarity of severe hail events and the lack of uniform detection methods. Here we present a new stochastic catalog of hailstorms for Europe. It is based on satellite observations of overshooting cloud tops (OT) that indicate very strong convective updrafts and hail reports from the European Severe Weather Database (ESWD). Historic hail events are defined based on OT detections from satellite infrared brightness temperatures between 2004 and 2011 for the warm seasons (April–September). The satellite-based historical event properties are complemented by hailstone observations from ESWD to stochastically simulate more than 1 million individual events with an event footprint resolution of 10 km. The final hail event catalog presented in this paper is the first one with a spatial event distribution that is based on a single homogeneous observation source over Europe. Areas of high hail probability or hail risk are found over Central and Southern Europe, including mountainous regions such as the Alps or the Pyrenees. Another region of relatively high hail risk is present over central Eastern Europe.},

abstract = {Gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) is a globally distributed air toxin with a long atmospheric residence time. Any process that reduces its atmospheric lifetime increases its potential accumulation in the biosphere. Our data from Barrow, AK, at 71 degrees N show that rapid, photochemically driven oxidation of boundary-layer Hg0 after polar sunrise, probably by reactive halogens, creates a rapidly depositing species of oxidized gaseous mercury in the remote Arctic troposphere at concentrations in excess of 900 pg m(-3). This mercury accumulates in the snowpack during polar spring at an accelerated rate in a form that is bioavailable to bacteria and is released with snowmelt during the summer emergence of the Arctic ecosystem. Evidence suggests that this is a recent phenomenon that may be occurring throughout the earth's polar regions.},

Because the values of the radar observables that delineate different particle types overlap and are not sharply defined, the problem is well suited for a fuzzy logic approach. In this preliminary study the authors have developed and implemented a fuzzy logic algorithm for hydrometeor particle identification that is simple and efficient enough to run in real time for operational use. Although there are no in situ measurements available for this particle-type verification, the initial results are encouraging. Plans for further verification and optimization of the algorithm are described.},

abstract = {This study tests hypothetical correspondences between size of severe hail, WSR-88D derived vertically in- tegrated liquid water (VIL), and an array of thermodynamic variables derived from computationally modified sounding analyses. In addition, these associations are documented for normalized VIL using various sounding parameters, and statistical predictive value is assigned to the various VIL-based and sounding variables. The database was gathered from Weather Service Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) units nationwide from cases identified during real-time operations and consists of over 400 hail events, each associated with a radar-observed VIL value and a modified observational sounding. Some parameters are found to increase in the mean with larger hail-size categories. Specific hail size, however, varies widely across the spectra of VIL, thermodynamic sounding variables, and combinations thereof, with only a few exceptions. No operationally useful parameters of value in hail-size prediction were discovered in the database of VIL and thermodynamic sounding data. These largely antihypothetical findings are compared with hail forecasting and warning techniques developed in the WSR-88D era—few in number and mostly regionalized and informal in nature—and with more widespread and empirical forecasting assumptions involving many of the same variables.},

abstract = {To explore associations of exposure to ambient and indoor air particulate and bio-aerosol pollutants with cardiovascular and respiratory disease markers, we utilized seven repeated measurements from 48 elderly subjects participating in a 4-week home air filtration study. Microvascular function (MVF), lung function, blood leukocyte counts, monocyte adhesion molecule expression, C-reactive protein, Clara cell protein (CC16) and surfactant protein-D (SPD) were examined in relation to exposure preceding each measurement. Exposure assessment included 48-h urban background monitoring of PM10, PM2.5 and particle number concentration (PNC), weekly measurements of PM2.5 in $\backslash$r$\backslash$nliving- and bedroom, 24-h measurements of indoor PNC three times, and bio-aerosol components in settled dust on a 2-week basis. Statistically significant inverse associations included: MVF with outdoor PNC; granulocyte counts with PM2.5; CD31 expression with dust fungi; SPD with dust endotoxin. Significant positive associations included: MVF with dust bacteria; monocyte expression of CD11 with PM2.5 in the bedroom and dust bacteria and endotoxin, CD31 expression with dust serine protease; serum CC16 with dust NAGase. Multiple comparisons demand cautious interpretation of results, which suggest that outdoor PNC have adverse effects on MVF, and outdoor and indoor PM2.5 and bio-aerosols are associated with markers of inflammation and lung cell integrity.},

abstract = {The assessment of noise sources for environmental purposes requires reliable methods for mapping. Numerical models are well adapted for sophisticated simulations and sensitivity analyses; however, real-time mapping of large frequency bands must be based on fast and acceptable computations and honor in situ measurements. In this paper, a real-time mapping procedure of noise exposure is proposed. The procedure is based on geostatistical modeling of spatial variations and applied to a case study taken from an experimental campaign, where a point source was placed on a flat meadow. An analytical approximation of the acoustic field was first computed with the Embleton model. The difference between this approximation and the actual measurements (L(eq15 min) 1/3-octave bands samples from 19 microphones spread over the meadow) showed spatial structure, which has been modeled with a variogram. Finally, the geostatistical technique of kriging with external drift provided an optimal interpolation of the acoustic field data while encapsulating the first approximation from the Embleton model. Systematic geostatistical inference and real-time mapping with the proposed procedure can be envisaged in simple cases.},

abstract = {Geomagnetic disturbances have affected electrical systems on the ground for over 150 years. The first effects were noted on the early telegraph in the 1840s and in this century magnetic storms have caused power system blackouts and phone system outages. Affected systems include all those that use electrical conductors: whether for transmission of power or signals or where the conducting properties are incidental to their use such as with pipelines and railway tracks. In power systems geomagnetically induced currents cause partial saturation of power transformers producing transformer heating and distortion of the ac waveform leading to misoperation of relays and other equipment. On pipelines, induced currents may contribute to corrosion but also present a problem with the electrical surveys of the pipe performed to monitor the corrosion prevention systems. Severity of these effects depends on disturbance size, proximity to the auroral zone, and the conductivity structure of the Earth. Also significant are system parameters such as the use of higher resistance coatings on pipelines and the linking of power systems into larger networks. In this paper we have attempted to catalogue all the published reports of geomagnetic effects on electrical systems and show their occurrence in the context of the solar cycle and geomagnetic activity variations for the years 1844 to 1996.},

It is shown that the choice of reference (e.g., random or persistence) can affect the perceived performance of the forecast system. Two scores, the equitable threat score (ETS) and the odds ratio benefit skill score (ORBSS), were chosen to show the impact of using a persistence forecast, first using some simple hypothetical scenarios and second for actual forecasts from the Met Office Unified Model (UM) of precipitation, total cloud cover, and visibility during 2006. Overall persistence offers a sterner test of true forecast added value and accuracy, but using a more realistic reference may come at a cost. Using persistence introduces an additional degree of freedom to the skill assessment, which may be rather variable for “weather parameters.” Ultimately, the aim of any forecasting system should be to achieve a substantive separation between the inherent skill of the reference (which represents b...},

Data from weather stations of the Hellenic National Meteorological Service (HNMS) indicated a mean yearly point frequency varying between 1 and 2 hail days for Central Macedonia. Crop insurance data from the Hellenic National Agricultural Insurance Organization (ELGA) showed a mean regional frequency of 22.3 hail days for the total cultivated area of Central Macedonia, about 6,500??km2, for the warm season, from April to September. Hailpad data representing almost one third of the total cultivated area of Central Macedonia, indicated a regional average of 8 hail days and 45 hailpads recording hail for the warm season. Spatial analysis over the hailpad area revealed a large variability of hail occurrence, with local maxima at the higher altitude and close to mountain barrier areas and a decreasing frequency over areas closer to the sea. The size distribution of a sample of 22,000 hailstones measured by the hailpads, showed a great majority, of 85.7{\%}, having diameters up to 11??mm. An inter-comparison of hail impact energies according to crop damaging potential indicated Central Macedonia hailfalls as the less intense compared to those of areas of Northern America. Application of the revised TORRO hail intensity scale extending to classes from H0 to H10, permitted a classification of Central Macedonia hailfalls appropriate for comparisons and correspondence between areas and countries about the severity and damaging of hailfalls. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Abstract Examples of automatic interpretation of polarimetric measurements made with an algorithm that classifies precipitation, from an Oklahoma squall line and a Florida airmass storm are presented. Developed in this paper are sensitivity tests of this algorithm to various polarimetric variables. The tests are done subjectively by comparing the fields of hydrometeors obtained using the full set of available polarimetric variables with a diminished set whereby some variables have been left out. An objective way to test the sensitivity of the algorithm to variables and rank their utility is also devised. The test involves definition of a measure, which is the number of data points classified into a category using subsets of available variables. Ratios of various measures (similar to probabilities) define the percentage of occurrence of a class. By comparing these percentages for cases in which some variables are excluded to those whereby all are included, a relative merit can be assigned to the variables. Results of this objective sensitivity study reveal the following: the reflectivity factor and differential reflectivity combined have the strongest discriminating power. Inclusion of the temperature profile helps eliminate a substantial number of spurious errors. Although the absence of temperature information degrades the scheme, it appears that the resultant fields are generally coherent and not far off from the fields obtained by adding temperature to the suite of polarimetric variables.},

In the extratropics, while the time-mean circulation primarily moves moisture zonally within ocean basins, low-frequency and synoptic anomalies drive much of the mean moisture transport both from ocean to land and toward the poles. In particular, during the cool-season low-frequency variability is the largest contributor to mean moisture transport into southwestern North America, Europe, and Australia. While some low-frequency transport originates in low latitudes, much is of extratropical origin due to large-scale atmospheric anomalies that extract moisture from the northeast Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

Scarchilli et al. generalized this concept in the self-consistency principle, which stated that, given a drop-shape model to describe the form of raindrops, the corresponding radar measurements are constrained on this three-dimensional surface. In this work the self-consistency principle is collapsed onto a two-dimensional domain defined by the variables: 1) the ratio between specific differential phase and reflectivity factor, and 2) differential reflectivity. In this space the scatter of drop size distribution (DSD) variability is minimized in such a way that drop-shape variability shows up. This methodology is used to observe for the first time the predominant shape of raindrops directly from the radar measurements. The radar polarimetric data were collected in two different climatological regions as central Florida and northern Italy. The significant result shows that the underlying mean axis ratio approaches the model established by Pruppacher and Beard, and the relationship described by Beard and Chuang forms a sort of border for the sphericity of the drop shape.},

abstract = {This paper describes the construction of an updated gridded climate dataset (referred to as CRU TS3.10) from monthly observations at meteorological stations across the world's land areas. Station anomalies (from 1961 to 1990 means) were interpolated into 0.5° latitude/longitude grid cells covering the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), and combined with an existing climatology to obtain absolute monthly values. The dataset includes six mostly independent climate variables (mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, precipitation, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure and cloud cover). Maximum and minimum temperatures have been arithmetically derived from these. Secondary variables (frost day frequency and potential evapotranspiration) have been estimated from the six primary variables using well-known formulae. Time series for hemispheric averages and 20 large sub-continental scale regions were calculated (for mean, maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation totals) and compared to a number of similar gridded products. The new dataset compares very favourably, with the major deviations mostly in regions and/or time periods with sparser observational data. CRU TS3.10 includes diagnostics associated with each interpolated value that indicates the number of stations used in the interpolation, allowing determination of the reliability of values in an objective way.

For the study, three multiport inlet rakes were mounted in windows downstream of an exhaust vent in locations forward, above, and aft of the right wing. These were used to make impact pressure measurements for determining boundary layer thickness ($\delta$) as well as to collect ambient air samples at various distances outward from the airframe. The fraction of cabin air in the samples was determined by doping the vent air with a metered amount of CO2, then monitoring air at the inlet ports for differential CO2 enhancements. Data were collected at altitudes ranging from the surface to 12 km, at various indicated airspeeds, pitch and yaw angles, and during vertical ascents and descents. Results indicate that $\delta$ varies from...},

abstract = {This paper discusses the outline structure and preliminary evaluation of an emission-dispersion model for predicting the temporal and spatial distribution of vehicle-derived airborne particulate matter mass concentration in {\v{Z}}. street canyons. The model is called Street Level Air Quality SLAQ . SLAQ is semi-empirical, in that it uses not only results from field and wind tunnel experiments but also theory and models derived from multiple runs of numerical routines in order to simulate the basic physical processes within the street canyon. A combination of a plume model, for the direct contribution of vehicle exhaust, and a box model for the recirculating part of the pollutants in the street, is used to predict concentration for receptors within the canyon. Emission rates of vehicle-derived particulate matter are calculated within SLAQ, which serve as input to the dispersion module. Exhaust emission rates are scaled element by element along the street for each of the lanes according to the direction of traffic flow to account for modal operation of vehicles near signalised intersections. This refinement allows SLAQ to account for non-uniform- ity in along-canyon emission rates and to model a street that has several intersections along its length. Thermal turbulence due to environmental surface sensible heat and vehicle-generated heat is accounted for in the model. Other features of SLAQ include correction for the urban heat island effect, dry deposition, wet deposition, particle settling and estimation of wind direction standard deviation, when this latter data is not available. SLAQ has been evaluated in a street in Loughborough, Leicestershire, United Kingdom and a correlation coefficient of 0.8 between the modelled and measured concentrations has been obtained.},

This landscape is comprised of more than 95{\%} of one woody plant species, Colophospermum mopane (Caesalpinaceae). Mopane woodlands extend over a broad area of southern Africa. A leaf cuvette technique was used to determine the emission capacities of the major vegetation and the temperature and light dependence of the emissions. In addition, relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) measurements of BVOC fluxes were made on a flux tower, where net CO2 emissions were also measured simultaneously. Large light-dependent emissions of terpenes (mostly $\alpha$-pinene and d-limonene) were observed from the mopane woodland. The diurnal BVOC emissions were integrated and compared with the CO2 flux. Monoterpene flux exceeded 3000 $\mu$g C m2 h1 during the daytime period, comparable to isoprene fluxes and much higher than terpene fluxes measured in most areas. The terpene flux constituted approximately 25{\%} of the diurnal net carbon exchange (CO2) during the experimental period. Other BVOC emissions may also contribute to the carbon exchange.},

abstract = {Abstract This article focuses on some recent changes observed in the Tropics with special emphasis on the African monsoon region using high-resolution gridded precipitation from the Climatic Research Unit (period 1979–2002), outgoing longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and atmospheric reanalyses from the Climate Prediction Center (NCEP-DOE2, period 1979–2007). The results show a rainfall increase in North Africa since the mid-90s with significant northward migrations of rainfall amounts, i.e. + 1.5° for the 400 mm July to September isohyets, whereas deep convection has significantly increased and shifted northward. The subsidence branch of the northern meridional overturning has also been reinforced and shifted by 1° latitude northward in winter. At larger scale, an unambiguous reorganisation of the circulation with increasing subsidence in high troposphere over the Mediterranean and increasing ascendance in the African Intertropical Convergence Zone in northern summer has been noticed in the meridional cell overturning. After 1993–1994, the migration of the Saharan heat low towards northwest has been more marked (+1° to + 2° in latitude; − 1° to − 2° in longitude), whereas its centre intensified at the peak of the tropical rainy season (+10 gpm thickness in the 700–925 hPa layer). These changes are associated with significant reinforcements of the southwesterly low-level winds and Tropical Easterly jet and with a northward shift of the African Easterly jet. Analyses of Global Circulation Model outputs issued from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (A1B scenario and from forced experiments on the ARPEGE-climat (Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle) and Atmospheric Global Circulation Model show that at least part of these changes could be due to the recent warming observed in the Mediterranean/Saharan region.

In addition, these associations are documented for normalized VIL using various sounding parameters, and statistical predictive value is assigned to the various VIL-based and sounding variables. The database was gathered from Weather Service Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) units nationwide from cases identified during real-time operations and consists of over 400 hail events, each associated with a radar-observed VIL value and a modified observational sounding. Some parameters are found to increase in the mean with larger hail-size categories. Specific hail size, however, varies widely across the spectra of VIL, thermodynamic sounding variables, and combinations thereof, with only a few exceptions. No operationally useful parameters of value in hail-size prediction were discovered in the database of VIL and thermodynamic sounding data. These largely antihypothetical findings are compared with hail forecasting and warning techniques developed in the WSR-88D era—few in number and mostly regionalized and informal in nature—and with more widespread and empirical forecasting assumptions involving many of the same variables.},

abstract = {Lightning activity in storms with overshooting tops and hail-producing storms over Central Europe is studied, in order to find typical lightning characteristics that can be useful in nowcasting of the severity of the storm and its ability to produce hail. The first part of the study gives the analysis of lightning activity in thunderstorms with overshooting tops (OT) for the warm part of the year (May-September) from 2009 to 2010 over central and southeastern Europe. Deep convective clouds with OT were detected in Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) data, using methods based on the infrared window (IRW, 10.8$\mu$m) channel and absorption channels of water vapor (WV, 6.2$\mu$m) and ozone (O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, 9.7$\mu$m) in the form of brightness temperature differences. The locations and times of the detected OT were compared to the distribution and types of lightning strokes, which were provided by the LINET Lightning Location System. The results show that the spatial distribution of lightning generally coincides with the spatial distribution of the detected OT. The largest numbers of lightning strokes and OT were found in western Hungary, southeastern Austria, northeastern Slovenia and the northern Adriatic. The largest number of OT occurred between 1600 and 1800 UTC, whereas from 0600 to 1000 UTC OT detections were rather rare. Lightning activity showed a similar temporal distribution, with an increase in lightning activity evident at or close to the time of the OT detections. At the time of and close to the location of the OT, the lightning was found to occur well above the tropopause and was clearly related to the OT of cumulonimbus clouds.In the second part of the study, lightning characteristics are studied for 35 events of hail-producing thunderstorms over Croatia in the summer months (May to September), from 2008 to 2012. The lightning distribution, also registered by LINET, was compared to hail parameters based on measurements at the hailpad polygon. A polygon with dimensions of 30. km. ×. 20. km was located in the area of highest average number of days with hail occurrence in the continental part of Croatia. In a majority of the studied cases, the number of total lightning strokes sharply increased slightly before the beginning of hailfall. At the time the hailfall started there is a brief decrease in the number of lightning strokes, followed by a sharp increase shortly after. Additionally, larger hailstones with higher kinetic energy values appeared at the beginning of the hailshower. Microphysical properties of the cloud tops, investigated using MSG SEVIRI 3.9. $\mu$m reflectivity, i.e. profiles of the effective radii of cloud particles vs. temperature, clearly verify the presence of strong updrafts associated with hail-producing clouds.},

abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of student peer evaluations in project teams to compare the reliability of two different evaluation procedures. The project teams consist of junior-level students in a mechanical engineering design course taught by Layton for five semesters in 1997, 1998, and 1999. The peer-evaluation instruments were used by students to evaluate their teammates' contributions to the team's deliverables—oral and written presentations of their solution to a technical design problem. The first instrument is an adaptation of the one advocated by Brown, in which students use a prescribed list of terms such as “excellent,” “very good,” “satisfactory,” and so forth. The second form, by Layton, asked students to assign a numerical rating (from 0 to 5) to 10 different aspects of contribution to the team. Analysis of variance was used to study the reliability of each of the instruments, using a special form by Crocker and Algina to study inter-rater reliability. The similarity of the reliability coefficients of the two instruments ( $\rho$ i=0.34 for Brown's instrument and $\rho$ i=0.41 for Layton's instrument) strengthens the assumption made in the first study—that data from the two instruments are similar enough to be normalized for comparison. At the same time, the higher reliability of Layton's instrument lends credence to Layton and Ohland's conclusion that focusing on identified behavioral characteristics of good teamwork (as Layton's instrument does) can improve peer evaluation. Layton's instrument accomplishes this to an extent, yielding a modest improvement in reliability. More focused attempts to define teamwork success behaviorally, such as the modification of Brown's instrument by Kaufman et al., may yield further improvements in reliability. The overall reliability of the two instruments validates such instruments as repeated measures of a consistent trait.},

Techniques for$\backslash$nnowcasting thunderstorm location were developed in the 1960s and$\backslash$n1970s by extrapolating radar echoes. The accuracy of these forecasts$\backslash$ngenerally decreases very rapidly during the first 30 min because$\backslash$nof the very short lifetime of individual convective cells. Fortunately$\backslash$nmore organized features like squall lines and supercells can be successfully$\backslash$nextrapolated for longer time periods. Physical processes that dictate$\backslash$nthe initiation and dissipation of convective storms are not necessarily$\backslash$nobservable in the past history of a particular echo development;$\backslash$nrather, they are often controlled by boundary layer convergence features,$\backslash$nenvironmental vertical wind shear, and buoyancy. Thus, successful$\backslash$nforecasts of storm initiation depend on accurate specification of$\backslash$nthe initial thermodynamic and kinematic fields with particular attention$\backslash$nto convergence lines. For these reasons the ability to improve on$\backslash$nsimple extrapolation techniques had stagnated until the present national$\backslash$nobservational network modernization program. The ability to observe$\backslash$nsmall-scale boundary layer convergence lines is now possible with$\backslash$noperational Doppler radars and satellite imagery.

abstract = {The notion of food security has an important history as a key concept for 20th-century policymakers. Two overarching perspectives on food security are identified. One centred on raising production as the core answer to under-consumption and hunger. The other is an emerging perspective, more social and ecological, accepting the need to address a complex array of problems, not just production. The first is primarily agricultural-focused; the latter a food systems approach. From its inception in post-World War 2 international reconstruction, the UN and governments have given tackling hunger a high profile, via a changing package of policy measures. Within a few decades, the production-oriented approach or paradigm was being questioned by the emerging paradigm with its more complex, multi-focused notion of the challenges ahead. When oil and agricultural commodity prices spiked in 2007–8, the complex agenda was marginalised by a renewed international focus on primary production and the needs of low-income countries. Against this background, the paper explores the diversity of perspectives on what is meant by food security, concluding that the core 21st-century task is to create a sustainable food system. This requires a more coherent policy framework than currently exists, a goal thwarted by competing solutions vying for policy attention and policy failure thus far to integrate the complex range of evidence from social as well as environmental and economic sources into an integrated policy response.},

@article{Feingold2010,
abstract = {Cloud fields adopt many different patterns that can have a profound effect on the amount of sunlight reflected back to space, with important implications for the Earth's climate. These cloud patterns can be observed in satellite images of the Earth and often exhibit distinct cell-like structures associated with organized convection at scales of tens of kilometres. Recent evidence has shown that atmospheric aerosol particles-through their influence on precipitation formation-help to determine whether cloud fields take on closed (more reflective) or open (less reflective) cellular patterns. The physical mechanisms controlling the formation and evolution of these cells, however, are still poorly understood, limiting our ability to simulate realistically the effects of clouds on global reflectance. Here we use satellite imagery and numerical models to show how precipitating clouds produce an open cellular cloud pattern that oscillates between different, weakly stable states. The oscillations are a result of precipitation causing downward motion and outflow from clouds that were previously positively buoyant. The evaporating precipitation drives air down to the Earth's surface, where it diverges and collides with the outflows of neighbouring precipitating cells. These colliding outflows form surface convergence zones and new cloud formation. In turn, the newly formed clouds produce precipitation and new colliding outflow patterns that are displaced from the previous ones. As successive cycles of this kind unfold, convergence zones alternate with divergence zones and new cloud patterns emerge to replace old ones. The result is an oscillating, self-organized system with a characteristic cell size and precipitation frequency.},

Particular attention was given to the climatological variability of the relationships and the uncertainty by which one rainfall parameter may be estimated from another. Substantial variability for the coefficients of a power-law relationship Y = AbXb between two rainfall parameters Y and X (where Y and X may stand for any paired combination of Z, R, and E) was found. The variability of the exponent b, however, was small enough to support approaches of climatologically fixed exponents to simplify radar rainfall estimation procedures. The multiplicative factor Ab should typically be adjusted on a storm basis.

abstract = {[ 1] This paper presents a detailed space-time analysis of rainfall rate using two dense networks of rain gauges covering two microscale areas of some 100 km 2 each and located in two distinct climatic areas in the United Kingdom and Spain. The study has been carried out with the main objective of addressing dynamic fade mitigation techniques and scatter interference problems in terrestrial and satellite communication systems. The two databases, using a total of 49 and 23 rain gauges, respectively, are described, and the continuous interpolated field used for the subsequent analyses is explained in detail. The suitability of the networks in terms of density, correlation distance, and fractal dimension are briefly addressed. A to-scale comparison grid of the networks is also given. It has been found that when the maximum intensity reached during a rain event surpasses a certain threshold, different for each of the two areas, rainfall rates exhibit a spatial structure in the form of closed contours of thresholds referred to as cells. In statistical terms, the most probable diameter found is about 3.5 km, and distributions are presented. They are similar for the two sites but not so for the maxima reached inside the cells. Using cross-correlation techniques, displacement and velocities are analyzed in detail. Cells "zigzag'' around a dominant trend because of the global cloud movements ( driven by winds at heights of about 700 hPa). Local topography strongly affects local behavior. Analytical approximations to the experimental statistical distributions and selected histograms of the results are presented.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a themed section on global environmental in/justice. In doing so it pays particular attention to two matters. First, it explores the value of a global' perspective on justice, highlighting how this framing reflects the nature and scales of contemporary environmental problems, the political-economic forces that pattern the uneven access to resources, and the vocabularies and narratives that are used to make claims about these inequities. Perhaps more significantly, the paper argues that a global framing appears to foreground particular aspects of environmental justice analysis, especially political and economic forces that produce injustices. Second, the introduction looks across the five papers in the section, each of which looks at a different environmental sector/issue: forests, transboundary waters, biodiversity conservation, energy and climate change, and disasters. It draws out the emergent themes across the papers, which involves discussions of the location of environmental struggles at new commodity frontiers, the limitations of distributive approaches to justice, and the relationship between social and environmental justice.},

abstract = {The fine particle and gas emissions from the residential wood combustion (RWC) appear to be a major contributor to winter-time pollution in Europe. In this study, we characterised the effect of two different combustion conditions on particulate and gaseous emissions from a conventional masonry heater. Normal combustion (NC) is the best available operational practice for the heater, whereas smouldering combustion (SC) mimicked slow heating combustion. It was found that the operational practice in RWC can significantly influence the quantity and quality of particle and gaseous emissions into the atmosphere. In SC, the emissions of carbon monoxide were 3.5-fold, total volatile organics 14-fold and PM1 6-fold to those of NC, whereas the mass of the inorganic compounds (“fine ash”) and particle number emissions were lower from SC than from NC. According to electron microscopy analyses, the observed fine ash particles seemed to occur mainly as separate spherical or irregularly shaped particles but not as agglomerates. Ultrafine ({\textless}100nm) fine ash particles were composed mainly of K, S and Zn, but also in a lesser extent of C, Ca, Fe, Mg, Cl, P and Na. Large agglomerates were found to contain mainly carbon and are considered to be primarily soot particles. The larger spherical and irregularly shaped particles were composed of same alkali metal compounds as ultrafine particles, but they were probably covered with heavy organic compounds. From SC, particles were composed mainly of carbon compounds and they had a more closed structure than the particles from NC, due to organic matter on the particles. In the present experiments, the ultrafine mode in the particle number distributions seemed to be determined mainly by the amount of released ash forming material in combustion, and the shifting of particle size during different combustion conditions seemed to be determined by the amount of condensed organic vapour in the flue gas.},

abstract = {CAPSULE A detailed overview of the uncharacteristic meteorological conditions that caused tropical-like, widespread, heavy rainfall and catastrophic flooding across the Colorado Front Range in September 2013. During the second week of September 2013 a seasonally-uncharacteristic weather pattern stalled over the Rocky Mountain Front Range region of northern Colorado bringing with it copious amounts of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea and the tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean. This feed of moisture was funneled towards the east facing mountain slopes by a series of mesoscale circulation features resulting in several days of unusually widespread heavy rainfall over steep mountainous terrain. Catastrophic flooding ensued within several Front Range river systems that washed away highways, destroyed towns, isolated communities, necessitated days of airborne evacuations, and resulted in eight fatalities (NWS, 2014). The impacts from heavy rainfall and flooding were felt over a broad region of northern Colorado leading to 18 counties being designated as federal disaster areas and resulting in damages exceeding {\$}2B. This study explores the meteorological and hydrological ingredients that led to this extreme event. After providing a basic timeline of events, synoptic and mesoscale circulation features of the event are discussed. Particular focus is placed on documenting how circulation features, embedded within the larger synoptic flow, served to funnel moist inflow into the mountain front driving several days of sustained orographic precipitation. Operational and research networks of polarimetric radar and surface instrumentation were used to evaluate the cloud structures and dominant hydrometeor characteristics. The performance of several quantitative precipitation estimates, quantitative precipitation forecasts, and hydrological forecast products are also analyzed with the intention of identifying what monitoring and prediction tools worked and where further improvements are needed.},

abstract = {Injecting sulfate aerosol precursors into the stratosphere has been suggested as a means of geoengineering to cool the planet and reduce global warming. The decision to implement such a scheme would require a comparison of its benefits, dangers, and costs to those of other responses to global warming, including doing nothing. Here we evaluate those factors for stratospheric geoengineering with sulfate aerosols. Using existing U.S. military fighter and tanker planes, the annual costs of injecting aerosol precursors into the lower stratosphere would be several billion dollars. Using artillery or balloons to loft the gas would be much more expensive. We do not have enough information to evaluate more exotic techniques, such as pumping the gas up through a hose attached to a tower or balloon system. Anthropogenic stratospheric aerosol injection would cool the planet, stop the melting of sea ice and land-based glaciers, slow sea level rise, and increase the terrestrial carbon sink, but produce regional drought, ozone depletion, less sunlight for solar power, and make skies less blue. Furthermore it would hamper Earth-based optical astronomy, do nothing to stop ocean acidification, and present many ethical and moral issues. Further work is needed to quantify many of these factors to allow informed decision-making.},

abstract = {Retrievals of sulfur dioxide (SO2) from space-based spectrometers are in a relatively early stage of development. Factors such as interference between ozone and SO2 in the retrieval algorithms often lead to errors in the retrieved values. Measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY), and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) satellite sensors, averaged over a period of several years, were used to identify locations with elevated SO2 values and estimate their emission levels. About 30 such locations, detectable by all three sensors and linked to volcanic and anthropogenic sources, were found after applying low and high spatial frequency filtration designed to reduce noise and bias and to enhance weak signals to SO2 data from each instrument. Quantitatively, the mean amount of SO2 in the vicinity of the sources, estimated from the three instruments, is in general agreement. However, its better spatial resolution makes it possible for OMI to detect smaller sources and with additional detail as compared to the other two instruments. Over some regions of China, SCIAMACHY and GOME-2 data show mean SO2 values that are almost 1.5 times higher than those from OMI, but the suggested spatial filtration technique largely reconciles these differences.

For the study, three multiport inlet rakes were mounted in windows downstream of an exhaust vent in locations forward, above, and aft of the right wing. These were used to make impact pressure measurements for determining boundary layer thickness ($\delta$) as well as to collect ambient air samples at various distances outward from the airframe. The fraction of cabin air in the samples was determined by doping the vent air with a metered amount of CO2, then monitoring air at the inlet ports for differential CO2 enhancements. Data were collected at altitudes ranging from the surface to 12 km, at various indicated airspeeds, pitch and yaw angles, and during vertical ascents and descents.

abstract = {Climate adaptation has become a pressing issue. Yet little attention has been paid to the consequences of adaptation policies and practices for sustainability. Recognition that not every adaptation to climate change is a good one has drawn attention to the need for sustainable adaptation strategies and measures that contribute to social justice and environmental integrity. This article presents four normative principles to guide responses to climate change and illustrates the significance of the ?sustainable adaptation? concept through case studies from diverse contexts. The principles are: first, recognize the context for vulnerability, including multiple stressors; second, acknowledge that differing values and interests affect adaptation outcomes; third, integrate local knowledge into adaptation responses; and fourth, consider potential feedbacks between local and global processes. We argue that fundamental societal transformations are required in order to achieve sustainable development pathways and avoid adaptation funding going into efforts that exacerbate vulnerability and contribute to rising emissions. Despite numerous challenges involved in achieving such change, we suggest that sustainable adaptation practices have the potential to address some of the shortcomings of conventional social and economic development pathways.

@article{Vet2014,
abstract = {A global assessment of precipitation chemistry and deposition has been carried out under the direction of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Scientific Advisory Group for Precipitation Chemistry (SAG-PC). The assessment addressed three questions: (1) what do measurements and model estimates of precipitation chemistry and wet, dry and total deposition of sulfur, nitrogen, sea salt, base cations, organic acids, acidity, and phosphorus show globally and regionally? (2) has the wet deposition of major ions changed since 2000 (and, where information and data are available, since 1990) and (3) what are the major gaps and uncertainties in our knowledge? To that end, regionally-representative measurements for two 3-year-averaging periods, 2000–2002 and 2005–2007, were compiled worldwide. Data from the 2000–2002 averaging period were combined with 2001 ensemble-mean modeling results from 21 global chemical transport models produced in Phase 1 of the Coordinated Model Studies Activities of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (TF HTAP). The measurement data and modeling results were used to generate global and regional maps of major ion concentrations in precipitation and deposition. A major product of the assessment is a database of quality assured ion concentration and wet deposition data gathered from regional and national monitoring networks. The database is available for download from the World Data Centre for Precipitation Chemistry (http://wdcpc.org/). The assessment concludes that global concentrations and deposition of sulfur and nitrogen are reasonably well characterized with levels generally highest near emission sources and more than an order of magnitude lower in areas largely free of anthropogenic influences. In many parts of the world, wet deposition of reduced nitrogen exceeds that of oxidized nitrogen and is increasing. Sulfur and nitrogen concentrations and deposition in North America and Europe have declined significantly in line with emission reduction policies. Major regions of the world, including South America, the more remote areas of North America, much of Asia, Africa, Oceania, polar regions, and all of the oceans, are inadequately sampled for all of the major ions in wet and dry deposition, and particularly so for phosphorus, organic forms of nitrogen, and weak acids including carbonates and organic acids. Measurement-based inferential estimates of dry deposition are limited to sulfur and some nitrogen in only a few regions of the world and methods are highly uncertain. The assessment concludes with recommendations to address major gaps and uncertainties in global ion concentration and deposition measurements.},

abstract = {Background-- Particulate air pollution has been consistently linked
to increased risk of arterial cardiovascular disease. Few data on
air pollution exposure and risk of venous thrombosis are available.
We investigated whether living near major traffic roads increases
the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), using distance from roads
as a proxy for traffic exposure. Methods and Results-- From 1995
through 2005, we examined 663 patients with DVT of the lower limbs
and 859 age-matched controls from cities with population {\textgreater}15 000
inhabitants in Lombardia Region, Italy. We assessed distance from
residential addresses to the nearest major traffic road using geographic
information system methodology. The risk of DVT was estimated from
logistic regression models adjusting for multiple clinical and environmental
covariates. The risk of DVT was increased (odds ratio=1.33; 95{\%} confidence
interval, 1.03 to 1.71; P=0.03 in age-adjusted models; odds ratio=1.47;
95{\%} confidence interval, 1.10 to 1.96; P=0.008 in models adjusted
for multiple covariates) for subjects living near a major traffic
road (index distance of 3 meters, 10th centile of the distance distribution)
compared with those living farther away (reference distance of 245
meters, 90th centile). The increase in DVT risk was approximately
linear over the observed distance range (from 718 to 0 meters) and
was not modified after adjusting for background levels of particulate
matter (odds ratio=1.47; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.96; P=0.008
for 10th versus 90th distance centile in models adjusting for area
levels of particulate matter {\textless}10 {\{}micro{\}}m in aerodynamic diameter
in the year before diagnosis). Conclusions-- Living near major traffic
roads is associated with increased risk of DVT.},

abstract = {Academic writing has traditionally been thought of as a convention-bound
monolithic entity that involves distant, convoluted and impersonal
prose. However, recent research has suggested a growing recognition
that there is room for negotiation of identity within academic writing,
and thus academic writing need not be totally devoid of a writer's
presence. In this article, we explore the notion of writer identity
in academic essays by focusing on first person pronouns, arguably
the most visible manifestation of a writer's presence in a text.
Our main argument is that the first person pronoun in academic writing
is not a homogeneous entity. Accordingly, we set up a typology of
six different identities behind the first person pronoun in academic
writing. We then apply this framework to a specific examination of
the essays of 27 first-year undergraduates at the National University
of Singapore. We focus on how the identities of these student writers
are revealed through uses of the first person pronoun, and reflect
on the implications of our results on issues of critical thinking
and writing education at the tertiary level.},

@article{landman_retro-active_2001,
abstract = {Sea-surface temperature {\{}(SST){\}} variations of the oceans surrounding southern Africa are associated with seasonal rainfall variability, especially during austral summer when the tropical atmospheric circulation is dominant over the region. Because of instabilities in the linear association between summer rainfall over southern Africa and {\{}SSTs{\}} of the tropical Indian Ocean, the skilful prediction of seasonal rainfall may best be achieved using physically based models. A two-tiered retro-active forecast procedure for the {\{}December-February{\}} {\{}(DJF){\}} season is employed over a 10-year period starting from 1987/1988. Rainfall forecasts are produced for a number of homogeneous regions over part of southern Africa. Categorized (below-normal, near-normal and above-normal) statistical {\{}DJF{\}} rainfall predictions are made for the region to form the baseline skill level that has to be outscored by more elaborate methods involving general circulation models {\{}(GCMs).{\}} The {\{}GCM{\}} used here is the Centre for {\{}Ocean-Land-Atmosphere{\}} Studies {\{}(COLA){\}} T30, with predicted global {\{}SST{\}} fields as boundary forcing and initial conditions derived from the National Centres for Environmental Prediction {\{}(NCEP){\}} reanalysis data. Bias-corrected {\{}GCM{\}} simulations of circulation and moisture at certain standard pressure levels are downscaled to produce rainfall forecasts at the regional level using the perfect prognosis {\{}approach.In{\}} the two-tiered forecasting system, {\{}SST{\}} predictions for the global oceans are made first. {\{}SST{\}} anomalies of the equatorial Pacific {\{}(NI{\~{N}}O3.4){\}} and Indian oceans are predicted skilfully at 1- and 3-month lead-times using a statistical model. These retro-active {\{}SST{\}} forecasts are accurate for pre-1990 conditions, but predictability seems to have weakened during the 1990s. Skilful multi-tiered rainfall forecasts are obtained when the amplitudes of large events in the global oceans (such as El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a episodes) are described adequately by the predicted {\{}SST{\}} fields. {\{}GCM{\}} simulations using persisted August {\{}SST{\}} anomalies instead of forecast {\{}SSTs{\}} produce skill levels similar to those of the baseline for longer lead-times. Given high-skill {\{}SST{\}} forecasts, the scheme has the potential to provide climate forecasts that outscore the baseline skill level substantially.

abstract = {The results are reported of pyranometric measurements of solar radiation in Arctic stratus decks made from aircraft flights over the Beaufort Sea during late July 1975. The reflectance of these cloud layers was nearly constant over the range of cloud thicknesses investigated, indicating the importance of the high surface reflectivity. The following ranges of reflectance are obtained: over the total solar spectrum, 60–750{\%}; visible spectrum, 70–85{\%}; near–infrared, 50–65{\%}. Transmittances for the cloud layers are presented as a function of cloud geometrical depth, and the bulk absorptance averaged over all cloud decks was 7{\%} in the total solar spectrum, and 5{\%} and 9{\%} in the visible and near–infrared, respectively. Additional cloud parameters, namely, single scatter albedo $\omega$˜vand absorption optical depth $\tau$v, are derived by fitting the upward and downward flux profiles from each flight to a two–stream approximation to estimate the absorption optical depth. By assuming a linear relation between absorption optical depth and cloud thickness, the scattering parameter $\beta$v, which defines the increased path length caused by multiple scattering, is determined from a best fit to the complete set of observed reflectances and transmittances. The following ranges of $\beta$v, are estimated: total solar, 8.75–10.7; visible, 9.01–14.3; near–infrared, 6.86–8.12. By assuming an asymmetry factor of 0.85 these values of $\beta$v yield estimates of the single scattering albedo ($\omega$v) of 0.994–0.996 over the total solar spectrum, 0.994–0.998 in the visible, and 0.990.993 in the near–infrared. Examples are presented of cloud absorption calculated with these derived values of $\omega$˜v.},

abstract = {Field measurements showed that there exists a correlation between nitrate and sulfate on mineral dust. In this work, the synergistic mechanism of adsorption and reaction between SO2 and NO2 on gamma-alumina was studied using in situ diffusion reflectance infrared Fourier spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD). The results revealed that the reaction pathway of NO2 adsorbed on alumina was altered in the presence of SO2. In the absence of SO2, nitrite was found to be an intermediate in the oxidation of NO2 to surface nitrate species. However, in the presence of SO2, the formation of nitrite was inhibited and a new intermediate, dinitrogen tetraoxide (N2O4), was observed. On the other hand, surface tetravalent sulfur species S(IV), including bisulfite and sulfite, were oxidized to sulfate in air condition when NO2 was present. The atmospheric implication of this synergistic effect was also discussed.},

abstract = {Building on previously published details of the laboratory calibrations
of the Harvard Lyman-{\$}\alpha{\$} photofragment fluorescence hygrometer (HWV)
on the NASA ER-2 and WB-57 aircraft, we describe here the validation
process for HWV, which includes laboratory calibrations and intercomparisons
with other Harvard water vapor instruments at water vapor mixing
ratios from 0 to 10 ppmv, followed by in-flight intercomparisons
with the same Harvard hygrometers. The observed agreement exhibited
in the laboratory and during intercomparisons helps corroborate the
accuracy of HWV. In light of the validated accuracy of HWV, we present
and evaluate a series of intercomparisons with satellite and balloon
borne water vapor instruments made from the upper troposphere to
the lower stratosphere in the tropics and midlatitudes. Whether on
the NASA ER-2 or WB-57 aircraft, HWV has consistently measured about
1–1.5 ppmv higher than the balloon-borne NOAA/ESRL/GMD frost point
hygrometer (CMDL), the NOAA Cryogenic Frost point Hygrometer (CFH),
and the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Aura satellite in regions
of the atmosphere where water vapor is {\textless}10 ppmv. Comparisons in the
tropics with the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) on the Upper
Atmosphere Research Satellite show large variable differences near
the tropopause that converge to {\~{}}10{\%} above 460 K, with HWV higher.
Results we show from the Aqua Validation and Intercomparison Experiment
(AquaVIT) at the AIDA chamber in Karlsruhe do not reflect the observed
in-flight differences. We illustrate that the interpretation of the
results of comparisons between modeled and measured representations
of the seasonal cycle of water entering the lower tropical stratosphere
is dictated by which data set is used.},

Evaluation of these models for emissions from quarries/open pit mines that are located in complex topography is missing from the literature. Due to severe uncertainties in the input parameters, numerous scenarios were simulated and model sensitivity was studied. Model results were compared among themselves, and to measured total suspended particulate (TSP). For a wide range of meteorological and topographical conditions studied, AERMOD predictions were in a better agreement with the measurements than those obtained by CALPUFF. The use of AERMOD's "Open pit" tool seems unnecessary when accurate digital topographic data are available.

abstract = {Emissions from fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning reduce local air quality and affect global tropospheric chemistry. Nitrogen oxides are emitted by all combustion processes and play a key part in the photochemically induced catalytic production of ozone, which results in summer smog and has increased levels of tropospheric ozone globally. Release of nitrogen oxide also results in nitric acid deposition, and--at least locally--increases radiative forcing effects due to the absorption of downward propagating visible light. Nitrogen oxide concentrations in many industrialized countries are expected to decrease, but rapid economic development has the potential to increase significantly the emissions of nitrogen oxides in parts of Asia. Here we present the tropospheric column amounts of nitrogen dioxide retrieved from two satellite instruments GOME and SCIAMACHY over the years 1996-2004.

abstract = {An inventory of annual and monthly emissions from small-scale residential wood combustion in Switzerland was prepared. Emissions from seven single room appliance classes ({\textless}15??kW) were included in the inventory. These systems were classified by technology (current or modern) and include batch fired and automatic systems. The inventory was developed using a novel method incorporating heating degree-days and appliance usage estimates. Emission factors used in the inventory are representative of normal combustion (NC) conditions for both current and modern appliances and poor combustion (PC) conditions for current appliances. Emissions factors for hard- and softwood combustion were incorporated where available. Particulate matter (PM), particle bound black carbon (BC), particle bound organic matter (POM), inorganic material, total organic carbon (TOC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were included in the inventory. PM was characterised by size as total particulate emissions (TPE), and as particulate matter having diameter less than 10, 2.5 and 1????m (PM 
                        10, PM 
                        2.5 and PM 
                        1, respectively).Annual emissions were determined for each emissions species (base year 2009). The hardwood softwood mix was assumed to be 57:43 and the mix of current and modern appliances was assumed to be 70:30. For the current emission scenario, annual TPE was calculated to be ???4.35??kt y 
                        -1, of which 39{\%} was BC and 42{\%} POM. TOC emissions were calculated to be ???3.82??kt y 
                        -1 for the same period and scenario. Analysis of the size dependency of PM was also made. PM 
                        2.5 dominated all combustion scenarios, contributing 76-85{\%} of TPE. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

France, namely Puy de D{\^{o}}me (45°46′19.2″N; 02°57′44.64″E; 1.464 km

that the vertical structure of temperature shows evidence for a Mesospheric
Inversion Layer (MIL) on those days on which sprites were observed.
A few events are also reported in which sprites were not recorded,
although there is evidence of a MIL in the vertical structure of
the temperature. It is proposed that breaking gravity waves produced
by convective thunderstorms facilitate the production of (1) sprites
by modulating the neutral air density and (2) MILs via the deposition
of energy. The same proposition has been used to explain observations
of lightings as well as both MILs and lightning arising out of deep
convections.},

abstract = {Thiry major storm that passed over Goodwin Creek, a small research watershed in northern Mississippi, were analysed to access the bias between radar rainfall estimates at rain gauge locations and the gauge amounts. These storms, each contributing at least 10 mm of storm total rainfall, accumulated approximately 785 mm of rain, which corresponds to about half the average annual rainfall amount for the area. The focus of the study was to demonstrate the importance of (1) bias adjustment of the radar rainfall estimates and (2) the quality control of the rain gauge data used for bias adjustment. The analysis is based on Memphis Weather Surveillence Radar - 1988 Doppler radar data, tipping-bucket rain gauge data, and raindrop spectra information collected within the Goodwin Creek catchment. Because of the measurement and rainfall estimation uncertainties, radar observations are often combined with rain gauge data to obtain the most accurate rainfall estimates. Rain gauge data, however, are subject to characteristic error sources: for Goodwin Creek, malfunctioning of the tipping-bucket rain gauges was frequently caused by biological and mechanical fouling and human interference. Therefore careful quality control of the rain gauge data is crucial, and only good quality rain gauge information should be used for adjusting radar rainfall estimates. By using high-quality gauge data and storm-based bias adjustment, we achieved radar rainfall estimates with root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) of approximately 10{\%} for storm total rainfall accumulations of 30mm or more. Differences resulting from radar data processing scenarios were found to be small compared to the effect caused by bias adjustment and using high-quality rain gauge data.},

A brief historical perspective is given to aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements over the oceans. A short summary of the existing data, collected on board ships of opportunity during the NASA Sensor Intercomparison and Merger for Biological and Interdisciplinary Oceanic Studies (SIMBIOS) Project is presented. Globally averaged oceanic aerosol optical depth (derived from island-based AERONET measurements) at 500 nm is -0.11 and Angstrom parameter (computed within spectral range 440-870 nm) is calculated to be -0.6. First results from the cruises contributing to the Maritime Aerosol Network are shown. MAN ship-based aerosol optical depth compares well to simultaneous island and near-coastal AERONET site AOD.

abstract = {The oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere is affected by anthropogenic emissions and is projected to change in the future. Model calculations indicate that the change in surface ozone at some locations could be large and have significant implications for human health. The calculations depend on the precise scenarios used for the anthropogenic emissions and on the details of the feedback processes included in the model. One important factor is how natural biogenic emissions will change in the future. We carry out a sensitivity calculation to address the possible increase in isoprene emissions consequent on increased surface temperature in a future climate. The changes in ozone are significant but depend crucially on the background chemical regime. In these calculations, we find that increased isoprene will increase ozone in the Northern Hemisphere but decrease ozone in the tropics. We also consider the role of bromine compounds in tropospheric chemistry and consider cases where, in a future climate, the impact of bromine could change.},

@article{Lozowski1978,
abstract = {This paper is a comparative study between the two most common hailpad calibration systems: one annual calibration of a whole consignment of material, and the individual calibration of each plate after a hailfall. Individual calibration attempts to minimize errors due to differences in sensitivity to the impact of hailstones between plates from the same consignment, or due to differences in the inking process before the actual measurement. The comparison was carried out using calibration data from the past few years in the hailpad network in south-western France, and data from an individual calibration process on material provided by the hailpad network in Lleida (Spain). The same type of material was used in the two cases. The results confirm that the error in measuring hailstone sizes is smaller in the case of an individual calibration of hailpads than when one single calibration process was carried out for a whole consignment. The former is approximately 80{\%} of the latter. However, this error could have been higher if it had not been the same person carrying out the single calibration process and the measuring of the dents: it has been found that differences in the inking process may account for up to 20{\%} of the error in the case of small hailstones. Calibration errors affecting other variables, e.g. energy or parameter $\lambda$ of the exponential size distribution are generally higher (5{\%} and 18{\%}, respectively) than errors due to the spatial variability of the hailstones. However, the calibration method does not influence the maximum size, since the relative error attributed to the spatial variability is about 8 times the calibration error. In conclusion, if errors in determining energy or parameter $\lambda$ are to be reduced to a minimum, it is highly advisable to be consistent in applying the measuring procedure (if possible with the same person carrying out the measurements all the time), and even to use individual calibration on each plate, always bearing in mind that technicians have to be trained appropriately in order to achieve the highest possible degree of uniformity. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A silver iodide (AgI) cloud-seeding parameterization has been implemented into the Thompson microphysics scheme of the Weather Research and Forecasting model to investigate glaciogenic cloudseeding effects. The sensitivity of the parameterization to meteorological conditions, cloud properties, and seeding rates was examined by simulating two-dimensional idealized moist flow over a bell-shaped mountain. The results verified that this parameterization can reasonably simulate the physical processes of cloud seeding with the limitations of the constant cloud droplet concentration assumed in the scheme and the two-dimensional model setup. The results showed the following: 1) Deposition was the dominant nucleation mode of AgI from simulated aircraft seeding, whereas immersion freezing was the most active mode for ground-based seeding. Deposition and condensation freezing were also important for groundbased seeding. Contact freezing was the weakest nucleation mode for both ground-based and airborne seeding. 2) Diffusion and riming on AgI-nucleated ice crystals depleted vapor and liquid water, resulting in more ice-phase precipitation on the ground for all of the seeding cases relative to the control cases.Most of the enhancement came from vapor depletion. The relative enhancement by seeding ranged from 0.3{\%} to 429{\%} under various conditions. 3) The maximum local AgI activation ratio was 60{\%} under optimum conditions. Under most seeding conditions, however, this ratio was between 0.02{\%} and 2{\%} in orographic clouds. 4) The seeding effect was inversely related to the natural precipitation efficiency but was positively related to seeding rates. 5) Ground-based seeding enhanced precipitation on the lee side of the mountain, whereas airborne seeding from lower flight tracks enhanced precipitation on the windward side of the mountain. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

@article{Masih2014,
abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive review and analysis of the available literature and information on droughts to build a continental, regional and country level perspective on geospatial and temporal variation of droughts in Africa. The study is based on the review and analysis of droughts occurred during 1900–2013, as well as evidence available from past centuries based on studies on the lake sediment analysis, tree-ring chronologies and written and oral histories and future predictions from the global climate change models. Most of the studies based on instrumental records indicate that droughts have become more frequent, intense and widespread during the last 50 years. The ex-treme droughts of 1972–1973, 1983–1984 and 1991–1992 were continental in nature and stand unique in the available records. Additionally, many severe and prolonged droughts were recorded in the recent past such as the 1999–2002 drought in northwest Africa, 1970s and 1980s droughts in western Africa (Sahel), 2010–2011 drought in eastern Africa (Horn of Africa) and 2001–2003 drought in southern and southeastern Africa, to name a few. The available (though limited) evidence before the 20th century confirms the occur-rence of several extreme and multi-year droughts during each century, with the most prolonged and intense droughts that occurred in Sahel and equatorial eastern Africa. The complex and highly variant nature of many physical mechanisms such as El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), sea surface tem-perature (SST) and land–atmosphere feedback adds to the daunting challenge of drought monitoring and forecasting. The future predictions of droughts based on global climate models indicate increased droughts and aridity at the conti-nental scale but large differences exist due to model limita-tions and complexity of the processes especially for Sahel and northern Africa. However, the available evidence from the past clearly shows that the African continent is likely to face extreme and widespread droughts in future. This evident challenge is likely to aggravate due to slow progress in drought risk management, increased population and demand for water and degradation of land and environment. Thus, there is a clear need for increased and integrated efforts in drought mitiga-tion to reduce the negative impacts of droughts anticipated in the future.},

abstract = {A stochastic space-time model of rainfall is proposed, which is defined by a small number of parameters and models rainfall intensity images measured by radar. It is a phenomenological (rather than a physically based) model which provides sequences of realistic stochastically generated rainfields over an area covered by an S-band weather radar sited near Bethlehem, South Africa. The weather types studied vary from predominantly scattered convective thunder-shower type rainfall through to widespread, general, stratiform rainfields with high Wetted Area Ratios. The methods of analysis and modelling of rainfall events as measured by radar are described. A three-dimensional (two space and one time) simulated rainfall event designed to mimic a real sequence is generated, analysed and compared to the observed rainfall event. Not only does it reproduce the statistics without obvious bias, it has been validated using the Generalized structure function. Variograms (specialisations of the Generalized structure function) fitted to the data measured by radar from a variety of rainfield types suggest that the correlation distance in rainfields is limited to between 12 and 25 km. The implication is that although the rainfields appear to be locally non-stationary, they are stationary over areas typically measured by radar. This is a post-justification for using methods based on the assumption that rainfields are stationary random fields and allows the use of straightforward statistical and spectral techniques which are the heart of the String of Beads model. This paper concentrates on modelling the rainfall process during a wet period, deferring the treatment of the inter-arrival of wet and dry periods to a follow-on paper. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {BackgroundGlobal Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 results show continued limitations of data quality and availability in most of the African region. Focused efforts in South Africa, however, have contributed to improved completeness and availability of mortality data, such that South Africa is currently undertaking a second National Burden of Disease Study. Mortality estimates have been developed nationally and for the nine provinces for 1997—2009.
MethodsVital registration data obtained for 1997—2009 were adjusted for completeness using indirect demographic techniques. A regression approach was used to identify misclassified AIDS deaths, and garbage codes were proportionally redistributed by age, sex, and population group. Injury deaths were estimated from additional data sources. Age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) trends for the nine provinces were calculated using ASSA 2008 population estimates and the WHO age standard.
FindingsAll-cause mortality peaked in 2006 and thereafter started to decline. ASMRs showed a two-fold difference between the highest-affected and lowest-affected provinces for the 1997—2009 period. ASMR from HIV/AIDS increased threefold since 1997 with provincial variation, while mortality from non-HIV-related tuberculosis declined. Mortality rates from non-communicable diseases decreased over the period nationally but increased for some provinces and remained stable for others as a result of differing trends in hypertensive heart disease and respiratory diseases. Nationally, preliminary analyses for 2009 show that HIV/AIDS was responsible for the highest number of deaths (31{\textperiodcentered}2{\%}; n=194 322 of 622 300 deaths), followed by cerebrovascular disease (6{\textperiodcentered}2{\%}; n=38 666), tuberculosis (5{\textperiodcentered}4{\%}; n=33 375), lower respiratory infections (5{\textperiodcentered}2{\%}; n=32 568), and ischaemic heart disease (4{\textperiodcentered}4{\%}; n=27 688). However, tuberculosis and interpersonal violence ranked among the top five causes for males, while hypertensive heart disease and ischaemic heart disease featured for females.
InterpretationThe downward trend in HIV/AIDS mortality can be attributed to the extensive antiretroviral treatment rollout since 2005. Differential provincial mortality trends reflect the different stages of epidemiological transition and differential health services in the provinces, providing relevant information for policy makers to address inequalities.

abstract = {Atmospheric aerosols cause scattering and absorption of incoming solar radiation. Additional anthropogenic aerosols released into the atmosphere thus exert a direct radiative forcing on the climate system. The degree of present-day aerosol forcing is estimated from global models that incorporate a representation of the aerosol cycles. Although the models are compared and validated against observations, these estimates remain uncertain. Previous satellite measurements of the direct effect of aerosols contained limited information about aerosol type, and were confined to oceans only. Here we use state-of-the-art satellite-based measurements of aerosols and surface wind speed to estimate the clear-sky direct radiative forcing for 2002, incorporating measurements over land and ocean. We use a Monte Carlo approach to account for uncertainties in aerosol measurements and in the algorithm used. Probability density functions obtained for the direct radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere give a clear-sky, global, annual average of -1.9 W m(-2) with standard deviation, +/- 0.3 W m(-2). These results suggest that present-day direct radiative forcing is stronger than present model estimates, implying future atmospheric warming greater than is presently predicted, as aerosol emissions continue to decline.},

The peak of the logarithmic spectrum (power density per unit natural
logarithm of frequency) is shown to be the most appropriate for defining
the scales (or frequencies) of the waves. The advantage of the logarithmic
spectrum becomes even more apparent when a wave consisting of the
positive part of a sine wave is considered. In that case, the conventional
frequency presentation is misleading because in addition to the erroneous
location of the spectral peak, an increase of power density towards
low frequencies occurs, giving the spectra the appearance of red
noise. For the same wave, it is shown that the logarithmic spectrum
has a single peak at the position corresponding with the actual wave
frequency.},

abstract = {It has been long understood that the partly cloudy atmosphere manifests
a continuum of states between the end members `clear' and `cloud.'
Nevertheless, many research methods are premised on a dichotomy of

Here we consider the consequences of this practice for studies of
aerosol-climate effects. Aerosols affect the Earth's energy budget
primarily by affecting albedo; therefore, we explore the nature of
albedo variability in the partly cloudy marine boundary layer on
scales down to a few tens of metres. We employ two diagnostic tools:
a cloud resolving model and an albedo proxy derived from high altitude
lidars. We show that a continuum of albedo values results from indeterminate
and variable combinations of hydrated aerosol and wispy (including
subvisible) clouds. Two consequences arise. First, cloud-clearing
schemes employed by different observational methods are mutually
inconsistent and are sensitive to concentrations of unactivated aerosol
particles. Second, aerosol radiative forcing (the sensitivity of
overall albedo to changes in aerosol concentration) is inaccurately
calculated as the average},

abstract = {We investigate how air-sea interaction affects an Intertropical Convergence
Zone (ITCZ) simulation in the SAMIL2.08 atmospheric general circulation
model (AGCM). In a control experiment (Exp1) with the observed sea
surface temperature (SST) prescribed in the AGCM, there exists a
problem of excessive precipitation over much of the Tropics and insufficient
precipitation over the equatorial Indian Ocean and the Pacific. The
equatorial drought belt arises from the compensatory descending motion
associated with exaggerated deep convection over the tropics in both
hemispheres. A double ITCZ disappears in a coupled experiment (Exp2)
with the same AGCM as used in Exp1 coupled to an interactive ocean
mixed layer within the great warm pool. This finding demonstrates
that local air-sea interaction can modify the SST pattern, thereby
regulating the climate mean state via the following processes. Local
air-sea flux exchanges in tropical convective regions such as the
ITCZ tend to cool SST via negative cloud-radiation and wind-evaporation
feedbacks. Such changes further modify the tropical atmospheric circulation
structure such that the equatorial compensatory descent in Exp1 is
replaced by the equatorial convergence zone, as seen in nature. A
third sensitivity experiment (Exp3), with the AGCM driven by the
monthly SST field derived from the coupled experiment, yielded similar
results to those obtained in Exp2. Overall, the results indicate
that a reasonable depiction of the air-sea coupling process is important
to successfully simulating the tropical precipitation pattern, as
the atmosphere is closely coupled with the ocean over the tropics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Epidemiological research into the role of traffic pollution
on chronic respiratory and allergic disease has focused primarily
on children. Studies in adults, in particular those based on objective
outcomes such as bronchial hyperresponsiveness, skin sensitisation,
and lung function, are limited.METHODS:We have used an existing cohort
of 2644 adults aged 18-70 living in Nottingham, UK, for whom baseline
health and demographic data were collected in 1991 and computed two
markers of exposure to traffic: distance between the home and nearest
main road and modelled outdoor nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration
at the home location. Using multiple regression techniques, we analysed
cross-sectional associations with bronchial hyperresponsiveness,
FEV1, spirometry-defined COPD, skin test positivity, total IgE and
questionnaire-reported wheeze, asthma, eczema and hayfever in 2599
subjects, and longitudinal associations with decline in FEV1 in 1329
subjects followed-up nine years later in 2000.RESULTS:There were
no significant cross-sectional associations between home proximity
to the roadside or NO2 level on any of the outcomes studied (adjusted
OR of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in relation to living [less than
or equal to]150 m vs {\textgreater}150 m from a road = 0.92, 95{\%} CI 0.68 to 1.24).
Furthermore, neither exposure was associated with a significantly
greater decline in FEV1 over time (adjusted mean difference in DeltaFEV1
for living [less than or equal to]150 m vs {\textgreater}150 m of a road = 10.03
ml, 95{\%} CI, -33.98 to 54.04).CONCLUSION:This study found no evidence
to suggest that living in close proximity to traffic is a major determinant
of asthma, allergic disease or COPD in adults.},

abstract = {We apply our Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiative (SNICAR) model, coupled to a$\backslash$ngeneral circulation model with prognostic carbon aerosol transport, to improve$\backslash$nunderstanding of climate forcing and response from black carbon (BC) in snow. Building$\backslash$non two previous studies, we account for interannually varying biomass burning BC$\backslash$nemissions, snow aging, and aerosol scavenging by snow meltwater. We assess uncertainty$\backslash$nin forcing estimates from these factors, as well as BC optical properties and snow$\backslash$ncover fraction. BC emissions are the largest source of uncertainty, followed by snow$\backslash$naging. The rate of snow aging determines snowpack effective radius (re), which directly$\backslash$ncontrols snow reflectance and the magnitude of albedo change caused by BC. For a$\backslash$nreasonable re range, reflectance reduction from BC varies threefold. Inefficient meltwater$\backslash$nscavenging keeps hydrophobic impurities near the surface during melt and enhances$\backslash$nforcing. Applying biomass burning BC emission inventories for a strong (1998) and weak$\backslash$n(2001) boreal fire year, we estimate global annual mean BC/snow surface radiative forcing$\backslash$nfrom all sources (fossil fuel, biofuel, and biomass burning) of +0.054 (0.007–0.13)$\backslash$nand +0.049 (0.007–0.12) W m⬚2, respectively. Snow forcing from only fossil fuel +$\backslash$nbiofuel sources is +0.043 W m⬚2 (forcing from only fossil fuels is +0.033 W m⬚2),$\backslash$nsuggesting that the anthropogenic contribution to total forcing is at least 80{\%}. The 1998$\backslash$nglobal land and sea-ice snowpack absorbed 0.60 and 0.23 W m⬚2, respectively, because of$\backslash$ndirect BC/snow forcing. The forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset,$\backslash$ntriggering strong snow-albedo feedback in local springtime. Consequently, the ‘‘efficacy''$\backslash$nof BC/snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by CO2. The 1998$\backslash$nand 2001 land snowmelt rates north of 50⬚N are 28{\%} and 19{\%} greater in the month$\backslash$npreceding maximum melt of control simulations without BC in snow. With climate$\backslash$nfeedbacks, global annual mean 2-meter air temperature warms 0.15 and 0.10⬚C, when BC$\backslash$nis included in snow, whereas annual arctic warming is 1.61 and 0.50⬚C. Stronger highlatitude$\backslash$nclimate response in 1998 than 2001 is at least partially caused by boreal fires,$\backslash$nwhich account for nearly all of the 35{\%} biomass burning contribution to 1998 arctic$\backslash$nforcing. Efficacy was anomalously large in this experiment, however, and more research is$\backslash$nrequired to elucidate the role of boreal fires, which we suggest have maximum arctic$\backslash$nBC/snow forcing potential during April–June. Model BC concentrations in snow agree$\backslash$nreasonably well (r = 0.78) with a set of 23 observations from various locations, spanning$\backslash$nnearly 4 orders of magnitude. We predict concentrations in excess of 1000 ng g⬚1 for$\backslash$nsnow in northeast China, enough to lower snow albedo by more than 0.13. The greatest$\backslash$ninstantaneous forcing is over the Tibetan Plateau, exceeding 20 W m⬚2 in some places$\backslash$nduring spring. These results indicate that snow darkening is an important component of$\backslash$ncarbon aerosol climate forcing.},

abstract = {Due to the impairment strong effects that atmospheric phenomena, mainly rain, produce in telecommunication systems, Fade Countermeasures (FCM) are required (e. g. Site diversity, Fade Mitigation Techniques). Therefore a better understanding and modeling of the space-temporal structure of rainfall is needed. Rainfall data collection is most commonly done by means of weather radars and rain gauges. While radars provide data with a high resolution both in space (a few square kilometers) and time (a few minutes) covering a large mesoscale (one hundred to one thousand square kilometers), rain gauges can work at a finer scale in time (seconds) but, spatially, they only provide punctual/local information. Thus merging both types of data should improve the existing rainfall models. This paper extends some first steps given in merging radar and rain gauge data for a better understanding of rainfall rate spatial structure. The study has been performed analyzing spatial correlation between sites within a densely meshed rain gauge network and also with their corresponding pixels in weather radar images.},

abstract = {In August through September 2004 the United Arab Emirates Unified Aerosol Experiment {\{}(UAE2){\}} was conducted in the southern Arabian Gulf region. We present atmospheric thermodynamic and aerosol data collected on 18 flights by the South African Aerocommander aircraft. In the first few kilometers, we observed high concentrations of both regional dust (from 100 to 300 $\mu$g m−3 in background, to over 1.5 mg m−3 in events) and ubiquitous sulfate based pollution from the Gulf's prevalent petroleum industry (10–100 $\mu$g m−3). Smoke and pollution from Europe and possibly Africa were found at levels between 1.5 and 5 km. Inland, classic deep over desert boundary layer characteristics were found. Over the Arabian Gulf, dust and pollution were most often either trapped below or sequestered above a strong stable boundary. However, there were cases where a well-distributed aerosol layer crossed the inversion uniformly. Data suggest that the observed vertical profiles can be explained by the rapid formation of stable marine boundary layers as air moves offshore. This can decouple aerosol layers from within the boundary layer to those aloft in regions of vertical wind shear. In the case of pollution, the ability of flaring plumes to penetrate the inversion may also in part determine layering. In coastal regions without vertical wind shear, uniform concentrations with height across the inversion are a result of internal boundary layer development. We conclude that the bulk of the observed variability in particle vertical distribution appear to be controlled by mesoscale and microscale processes, such as the sea/land breeze.},

abstract = {An estimated 95{\%} of the population of Ethiopia uses traditional biomass fuels, such as wood, dung, charcoal, or crop residues, to meet household energy needs. As a result of the harmful smoke emitted from the combustion of biomass fuels, indoor air pollution is responsible for more than 50,000 deaths annually and causes nearly 5{\%} of the burden of disease in Ethiopia. Very limited research on indoor air pollution and its health impacts exists in Ethiopia. This study was, therefore, undertaken to assess the magnitude of indoor air pollution from household fuel use in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. During January and February, 2012, the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in 59 households was measured using the University of California at Berkeley Particle Monitor (UCB PM). The raw data was analysed using Statistical Package of Social Science (SPSS version 20.0) software to determine variance between groups and descriptive statistics. The geometric mean of 24-hindoor PM2.5 concentration is approximately 818??gm-3 (Standard deviation (SD=3.61)). The highest 24-hgeometric mean of PM2.5 concentration observed were 1134??gm-3 (SD=3.36), 637??gm-3 (SD=4.44), and 335??gm-3 (SD=2.51), respectively, in households using predominantly solid fuel, kerosene, and clean fuel. Although 24-hmean PM2.5 concentration between fuel types differed statistically (P{\textless}0.05), post hoc pairwise comparison indicated no significant difference in mean concentration of PM2.5 between improved biomass stoves and traditional stoves (P{\textgreater}0.05). The study revealed indoor air pollution is a major environmental and health hazard from home using biomass fuel in Addis Ababa. The use of clean fuels and efficient cooking stoves is recommended. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The total column density nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) retrievals collated by a ground-based sun-tracking spectrometer (Pandora/GSFC) and the satellite-borne (Aura) Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) were compared to the volume mixing ratios measured by a ground-based gas-analyser at Welgegund, North-West University (NWU) atmospheric monitoring station (Potchefstroom, South Africa). An assessment of the comparability between columnar and surface NO 2 measurements was performed. The concurrent ground measurements results over January-March, 2011, were averaged over one hour to correspond to the closest local OMI overpasses ({\~{}}12:00 UTC). A novel method for estimating surface mixing ratios from total-column retrievals, via a planetary boundary layer (PBL) height correction factor as tested by Knepp et al. (2013) in the USA was applied. This PBL correction factor largely corrects for boundary-layer variability throughout the day, and allows conversion into mixing ratios. The data for the ground instruments were in agreement within the expected uncertainty for each technique and between two remote sensing instruments. However, NO 2 between the ground gas analyser and satellite borne instrument were out of the expected uncertainty limits.},

@article{Edwards2003,
abstract = {Residential energy use in developing countries has traditionally been associated with combustion devices of poor energy efficiency, which have been shown to produce substantial health-damaging pollution, contributing significantly to the global burden of disease, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Precision of these estimates in China has been hampered by limited data on stove use and fuel consumption in residences. In addition limited information is available on variability of emissions of pollutants from different stove/fuel combinations in typical use, as measurement of emission factors requires measurement of multiple chemical species in complex burn cycle tests. Such measurements are too costly and time consuming for application in conjunction with national surveys. Emissions of most of the major health-damaging pollutants (HDP) and many of the gases that contribute to GHG emissions from cooking stoves are the result of the significant portion of fuel carbon that is diverted to products of incomplete combustion (PIC) as a result of poor combustion efficiencies. The approximately linear increase in emissions of PIC with decreasing combustion efficiencies allows development of linear models to predict emissions of GHG and HDP intrinsically linked to CO2 and PIC production, and ultimately allows the prediction of global warming contributions from residential stove emissions. A comprehensive emissions database of three burn cycles of 23 typical fuel/stove combinations tested in a simulated village house in China has been used to develop models to predict emissions of HDP and global warming commitment (GWC) from cooking stoves in China, that rely on simple survey information on stove and fuel use that may be incorporated into national surveys. Stepwise regression models predicted 66{\%} of the variance in global warming commitment (CO2, CO, CH4, NOx, TNMHC) per 1 MJ delivered energy due to emissions from these stoves if survey information on fuel type was available. Subsequently if stove type is known, stepwise regression models predicted 73{\%} of the variance. Integrated assessment of policies to change stove or fuel type requires that implications for environmental impacts, energy efficiency, global warming and human exposures to HDP emissions can be evaluated. Frequently, this involves measurement of TSP or CO as the major HDPs. Incorporation of this information into models to predict GWC predicted 79{\%} and 78{\%} of the variance respectively. Clearly, however, the complexity of making multiple measurements in conjunction with a national survey would be both expensive and time consuming. Thus, models to predict HDP using simple survey information, and with measurement of either CO/CO2 or TSP/CO2 to predict emission factors for the other HDP have been derived. Stepwise regression models predicted 65{\%} of the variance in emissions of total suspended particulate as grams of carbon (TSPC) per 1 MJ delivered if survey information on fuel and stove type was available and 74{\%} if the CO/CO2 ratio was measured. Similarly stepwise regression models predicted 76{\%} of the variance in COC emissions per MJ delivered with survey information on stove and fuel type and 85{\%} if the TSPC/CO2 ratio was measured. Ultimately, with international agreements on emissions trading frameworks, similar models based on extensive databases of the fate of fuel carbon during combustion from representative household stoves would provide a mechanism for computing greenhouse credits in the residential sector as part of clean development mechanism frameworks and monitoring compliance to control regimes.},

The first estimate is derived from a physically-based hydrological model (TOPKAPI). The second estimate is derived from the scatterometer on board the European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS). Results show a good correspondence between the modelled and remotely sensed soil moisture, particularly with respect to the soil moisture dynamic, illustrated over two selected seasons of 8 months, yielding regression R2 coefficients lying between 0.68 and 0.92. Such a close similarity between these two different, independent approaches is very promising for (i) remote sensing in general (ii) the use of hydrological models to back-calculate and disaggregate the satellite soil moisture estimate and (iii) for hydrological models to assimilate the remotely sensed soil moisture.},

of continental emissions, particularly from North America, influences
the concentrations of trace species in the troposphere over the North

abstract = {The emissions of trace gases and particles resulting from extensive vegetation fires in southern and central Africa are estimated from the amount of fuel consumed and emission factors determined during the Southern Africa Fire-Atmosphere Research Initiative (SAFARI-92) field campaign. The fuel consumption estimates are from the modeling approach of Scholes et al. this issue. The emission factors are a function of the ''combustion efficiency,'' a measure of the oxygenation state of the fire. Combustion efficiency is in turn related to the types of fuel consumed. Most of the burning in southern Africa takes place in savannas during the dry season. The main fuel is dry grass, which burns with high efficiency and produces relatively low emissions of methane, carbon monoxide, and aerosols per unit mass of fuel consumed. The combination of the reduced estimates of amount of biomass burned and the low emission factors results in subcontinental emission estimates for CH4, CO, NOx, and aerosols which are substantially lower than previous estimates. The estimates for the nominal year 1989 are 14.9 Tg CO, 0.500 Tg CH4, 1.06 Tg NOx, and 1.08 Tg particles ({\textless}2.5 mu m). Approximately 324 Tg CO2 is released by vegetation fires and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, is assumed to be reabsorbed by subsequent regrowth. The pyrogenic emissions are concentrated in the area between 5 degrees and 20 degrees S and in the months between June and October, with a peak in August.},

Municipalities, however, are subject to a host of challenges and barriers to action, revealing the critical need for sophisticated participatory processes in support of municipal decision-making under conditions of considerable uncertainty. This paper examines a new process for envisioning local climate change futures, which uses an iterative, collaborative, multistakeholder approach to produce computer-generated 3-dimensional images of climate change futures in the flood-prone municipality of Delta, British Columbia, Canada. The process appeared to forge communicative partnerships, which may improve the legitimacy and effectiveness of the flood management and climate change response discourse in the municipality of Delta, and may lead to locally specific and integrated flood management and climate change response strategies. We concluded that, while an enabling context and normative pressures are clearly integral to effective action, so too is the type and mode of presentation of information about climate futures.},

abstract = {Urbanization in China accompanies economic development and population growth. Changes in land use leads to changes in both meteorological and chemical fields. In this study, the impact of land use change in Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ, indicating Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) areas on meteorology and ozone concentrations are studied using the WRF–Chem model. Land use change is represented by two different land cover data sets: USGS and MODIS. Monthly-average simulations show that urbanization causes an increase in 2-m temperature by maximum 2.4 °C and 3.2 °C in these two areas, respectively. Wind speed simulations suggest a decrease (average 1.2 m s−1) in daytime for YRD, and in nighttime for JJJ. Dew point differences show a dry effect over both areas, with maximum −3 °C in JJJ and −2.4 °C in YRD. Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) height increases by 400 m (maximum in JJJ) and 600 m (maximum in YRD) for daytime, and nighttime increases are less than 100 m. Daytime ozone concentrations in JJJ increase by 20 ppb due to urbanization, while in YRD the difference is around 5 ppb. Compared to observations, mean errors in urban areas was improved when using updated land use information by 14.2{\%} and 35.6{\%}, and in suburban areas by 5.8{\%} and 10.7{\%}. Updating land use data set in air quality modeling is important in application to regions with rapid urbanization such as China. The effects due to land use change can be as large as those due to 20{\%} increase in emissions.},

Simulated$\backslash$naerosols were found to induce changes in the regional surface fluxes$\backslash$nand atmospheric dynamics. Clear-sky surface radiative forcing decreased$\backslash$nby up to −60 W/m2 in the main biomass burning region, resulting in$\backslash$ndecreased surface turbulent fluxes and PBL height as well as reduced$\backslash$nsurface temperatures. The positive temperature bias over the western$\backslash$nhalf of the subcontinent was thus reduced. Radiative absorption by$\backslash$nbiomass burning aerosols resulted in diabatic warming of the atmosphere,$\backslash$npeaking near 700 hPa at a rate of up to 1°C/d. Simulated surface$\backslash$ncooling and heating at altitude stabilized the lower troposphere$\backslash$nbelow 700 hPa.

abstract = {The prevalence of asthma and allergic disease in children has been increasing in developed countries, but there is little information on these trends in Africa. The aim of this study was to assess time trends in the symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic eczema among South African adolescents. The study was carried out by comparing cross-sectional data from two International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC phase I and phase III) questionnaire based surveys conducted 7 yr apart of self-reported symptoms in 13- to 14-yr-old adolescents. In both surveys, schools in the same geographical area in Cape Town, South Africa, were randomly selected. A school-based sample of 5178 (in 1995) and 5037 (in 2002) pupils participated. The 12-month prevalence of wheezing (16{\%} vs. 20.3{\%}), exercise-induced wheeze (21.5{\%} vs. 32.5{\%}), nocturnal cough (23.6{\%} vs. 36.6{\%}), sleep disturbance due to wheeze (9.6{\%} vs. 16{\%}), or severe wheeze (5.1{\%} vs. 7.8{\%}) increased significantly, as measured by the written questionnaire. A rise in asthma symptoms was confirmed by the video questionnaire responses, in which the 12-month prevalence of wheezing (6.5{\%} vs.11.2{\%}), exercise-induced wheeze (11.5{\%} vs. 13.9{\%}), nocturnal wheeze (3.9{\%} vs. 5.3{\%}), nocturnal cough (11.6{\%} vs. 19.2{\%}), or severe wheeze (5{\%} vs. 7{\%}) also increased significantly. There was a small increase in the percentage of children diagnosed with asthma from 1995 to 2002 (13.1{\%} vs. 14.4{\%}), this was not significant. The 12-month prevalence of symptoms of allergic rhinitis (30.4{\%} vs. 38.5{\%}), rhinoconjunctivitis (17.6{\%} vs. 24.3{\%}) and eczema (11.8{\%} vs. 19.4{\%}) also increased significantly. An increase in the prevalence of allergic symptoms occurred in girls and boys. Limitation of daily activity from nasal symptoms (22.3{\%} vs. 37.8{\%}) and sleep disturbance because of eczema (8.4{\%} vs. 15.7{\%}) increasingly affected quality of life on the quality of life. Symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic eczema in adolescents have increased over the past 7 yr in this geographical area. Allergic diseases are common in this group of adolescents and increasingly impair their quality of life.},

abstract = {Atmospheric mercury depletion episodes (AMDEs) were studied at Station Nord, Northeast Greenland, 81 degrees 36' N, 16 degrees 40' W, during the Arctic Spring. Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) and ozone were measured starting from 1998 and 1999, respectively, until August 2002. GEM was measured with a TEKRAN 2735A automatic mercury analyzer based on preconcentration of mercury on a gold trap followed by detection using fluorescence spectroscopy. Ozone was measured by UV absorption. A scatter plot of GEM and ozone concentrations confirmed that also at Station Nord GEM and ozone are linearly correlated during AMDEs. The relationship between ozone and GEM is further investigated in this paper using basic reaction kinetics (i.e., Cl, ClO, Br, and BrO have been suggested as reactants for GEM). The analyses in this paper show that GEM in the Arctic troposphere most probably reacts with Br. On the basis of the experimental results of this paper and results from the literature, a simple parametrization for AMDE was included into the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM). In the model, GEM is converted linearly to reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) over sea ice with temperature below -4 degrees C with a lifetime of 3 or 10 h. The new AMDE parametrization was used together with the general parametrization of mercury chemistry [Petersen, G.; Munthe, J.; Pleijel, K.; Bloxam, R.; Vinod Kumar, A. Atmos. Environ. 1998, 32, 829-843]. The obtained model results were compared with measurements of GEM at Station Nord. There was good agreement between the start and general features periods with AMDEs, although the model could not reproduce the fast concentration changes, and the correlation between modeled and measured values decreased from 2000 to 2001 and further in 2002. The modeled RGM concentrations over the Arctic in 2000 were found to agree well with the temporal and geographical variability of the boundary column of monthly average BrO observed by the GOME satellite. Scenario calculations were performed with and without AMDEs. For the area north of the Polar Circle, the mercury deposition increases from 89 tons/year for calculations without an AMDE to 208 tons/year with the AMDE. The 208 tons/year represent an upper limit for the mercury load to the Artic.},

The pump consists of a large (17 L) spherical body divided into two chambers by means of a thin neoprene diaphragm. The pressure drop generated across an air intake and air exhaust mounted outside the aircraft drives sample air into this spherical body while the diaphragm is displaced completely to align the inside of the pump body. The air thus collected is subsequently forced into the inlet of a high-pressure compressor by letting aircraft cabin air fill the pump body from the other side of the diaphragm. The pumping cycle is controlled by the position of the diaphragm and is self-sustaining. The pressure at the intake of the high-pressure compressor is thus maintained close to that of the cabin pressure, which results in a three- to fourfold pressure boost. In this way the pumping speed of the high-pressure compressor is e...},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Climate change is expected to bring increases in average global temperatures (1.4 ° Ce5.8°C [34.52°Fe42.44°F] by 2100) and precipitation levels to varying degrees around the globe. The availability and quality of water will be severely affected, and public health threats from the lack of this valuable resource will be great unless water-scarce nations are able to adapt. Saudi Arabia provides a good example of how the climate and unsustainable human activity go hand in hand in creating stress on and depleting water resources, and an example for adaptation and mitigation. METHOD A search of the English literature addressing climate change, water scarcity, human health, and related topics was conducted using online resources and databases accessed through the University at Albany, State University of New York library web page. RESULTS Water scarcity, which encompasses both water availability and water quality, is an important indicator of health. Beyond drinking, water supply is intimately linked to food security, sanitation, and hygiene, which are primary contributors to the global burden of disease. Poor and disadvantaged populations are the ones who will suffer most from the negative effects of climate change on water supply and associated human health issues. Examples of adaptation and mitigation measures that can help reduce the strain on conventional water resources (surface waters and fossil aquifers or groundwater) include desalination, wastewater recycling and reuse, and outsourcing food items or "virtual water trade." These are strategies being used by Saudi Arabia, a country that is water poor primarily due to decades of irresponsible irrigation practices. The human and environmental health risks associated with these adaptation measures are examined. Finally, strategies to protect human health through international collaboration and the importance of these efforts are discussed. CONCLUSION International, multidisciplinary cooperation and collaboration will be needed to promote global water security and to protect human health, particularly in low-income countries that do not have the resources necessary to adapt on their own.},

In this article, I review the climatology literature that examines the relationship between cities and atmospheric changes at all scales. Despite the volume of literature on this theme, there is little overall coherence. In part, this is a result of the varying operational definitions of the city and the difficulty in obtaining pertinent information. Rather than attempt to provide a comprehensive review of the literature that focuses on cities and global change, this article categorises published research on the relationship between urban areas and climate changes at all scales into common themes.

abstract = {Radar observations of rainfall and their use in hydrologic research provide the focus for the paper. Radar-rainfall products are crucial for input to runoff and flood prediction models, validation of satellite remote sensing algorithms, and for statistical characterization of extreme rainfall frequency. In this context we discuss the issues of radar-rainfall product development, and the theoretical and practical requirements of validating radar-rainfall maps and new radar technologies. We discuss a framework for relfectivity based rainfall estimation, including estimation of uncertainty of radar-rainfall estimates. Validation of radar-rainfall products is a major challenge for broad utilization of these products in hydrologic applications. In the discussion of radar-rainfall prediction we focus on orographically induced extreme rainfall and flooding, discuss the issues of detection, statistical sample size, and scale effects. We conclude the paper with a set of recommendations for research priorities and experimental requirements to address them. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There is consensus that carbon pricing is required to support a lower carbon pathway for South Africa. However, a debate remains on the most appropriate mechanism to introduce such a price. Although theoretically similar under restrictive assumptions, carbon taxes and emissions trading have very different environmental and economic implications in practice. The differences between price and quantity instruments remain fundamental, but there are other important criteria when comparing instruments. On the basis of a broad set of public policy criteria, carbon taxation appears to have many merits for a middle-income developing country like South Africa. The concentrated market structure of the country's energy sector raises concerns about the ability to construct a competitive and efficient emissions trading market and further supports taxation as the more appropriate instrument for the country. Other considerations are the relative political credibility, welfare impacts and long-term stability of each instrument. A comparison of the instruments should not, however, be treated as an either/or choice, as much depends on the design of each instrument. The evaluation of the instruments in South African circumstances suggests potential criteria for evaluation and instrument modifications, which may also be useful for other developing countries.

abstract = {Understanding of water resources and trends of water consumptions is important to offer sustainable water resources management strategy. In this research, water resources and trends of water consumptions in Saudi Arabia were investigated. The non-renewable groundwater reserves were estimated to be 259.1–760.6 billion cubic meters (BCM) with an effective annual recharge of 886 million cubic meters (MCM). The total internal renewable water was estimated to be 2.4 BCM/year. Approximately 1.4 BCM/year of runoff is collected by 302 dams. The country produces approximately 1.06 BCM desalinated water annually. The wastewater treatment plants treat approximately 0.73 BCM/year of domestic wastewater from which 0.33 BCM is recycled. The water demand in 2009 was 18.51 BCM in which 83.5{\%} were for agriculture. From 2004 to 2009, agricultural water demand was decreased by 2.5{\%}/year, while the domestic and industrial water demands were increased by 2.1{\%}/year and 2.2{\%}/year, respectively. Between 1999 and 2008, domestic water subscribers were increased by 22.7{\%}, while the annual domestic water consumption was increased from 1391 (609–2164) to 3818 (1687–7404) m3/subscriber. The industrial water demands were increased from 56 to 713 MCM/year between 1980 and 2009. Following characterization, nonlinear equations were developed to predict the domestic, industrial and agricultural water demands. The predicted water demands were within 1–10{\%} of the historically reported values. The findings might be useful in understanding water sources, water demands and identifying new sources for sustainable water resources management.},

abstract = {Abstract The First ATSR Tropical Experiment was carded out in November 1991 over the tropical Atlantic to validate daytime measurements of sea surface temperature (SST) made by the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) on the European remote sensing satellite, ERS-1. An airborne infrared radiometer with channels at 11 and 12 µm spectrally matched to those on the ATSR was used to make nadir, 60° to nadir, and zenith view radiance measurements at a number of different altitudes from 70 m to 8 km above the sea surface. The effect of stratospheric aerosols on the ATSR radiances, due to the June 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, was quantified as nadir view brightness temperature deficits of up to 0.6 K at 11 µm. ATSR retrievals of SST (using both nadir and forward views) were compared with SSTs inferred from low-level radiance measurements of the sea surface that were unaffected by atmospheric absorption. ATSR SSTs retrieved using the nadir only views had negative (i.e., cold) biases of about 2 K. If the forw...},

abstract = {This paper addresses the future of environmental assessment (EA) practice in light of a rapidly changing world. We apply a literature review-based methodology to firstly identify key global megatrends and then reflect upon the implications for EA practice based on some known challenges. The key megatrends identified are synthesised into six categories: i) demographics, ii) urbanization, iii) technological innovation, iv) power shifts, v) resource scarcity and vi) climate change. We then discuss the implications of these megatrends for EA practice against four known EA challenges namely: dealing with i) complexity and uncertainty, ii) efficiency, iii) significance and iv) communication and participation. Our analysis suggests important implications for EA practice such as: increased difficulties with accuracy of prediction; the need for facilitative adaptation; an increase in the occurrence of unexpected events; higher expectations for procedural efficiency; challenges with information and communication management; dealing with significance judgements; and mitigation amidst resource scarcity and increasing pressures on earth systems. The megatrends underscore the need for continued evolution of EA thinking and practice, especially moving away from seeking a predictable single future or outcome towards the possibility of multiple scenarios with associated adaptability and enhanced system resilience capable of responding to rapid change.},

Our objective is to critically evaluate the usefulness of the reanalysis products for studies of the global hydrologic cycle. The study period is from January 1985 to December 1993. Monthly mean water vapor transport, evaporation, and precipitation are compared to the NASA Data Assimilation Office (DAO) reanalysis for roughly the same period and with satellite estimates and station observations. Comparisons of the moisture flux fields form the NCEP and the DAO reanalyses show general agreement in most aspects, but there are regional differences. Discrepancies in tropical moisture transport are largely due to uncertainties in the divergent winds. The DAO reanalysis shows a weaker Hadley circulation and weaker cross-equatorial flow, particularly during the Northern Hemisphere winter. Global patterns of evaporation f...},

This project, funded by the State of Wyoming, is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of cloud seeding with silver iodide in the Medicine Bow and Sierra Madre Ranges of south-central Wyoming. The statistical evaluation is based on a randomized crossover design for the two barriers. The description of the experimental design includes the rationale behind the design choice, the criteria for case selection, facilities for operations and evaluation, and the statistical analysis approach. Initial estimates of the number of cases needed for statistical significance used historical Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) data (1987–2006), prior to the beginning of the randomized seeding experiment. Refined estimates were calculated using high-resolution precipitation data collected during the initial seasons of the project (2007–10).

abstract = {Policymakers at global level recognise that household biomass use in developing countries has significant health consequences. However, it is unclear how local-level health professionals perceive and respond to such health effects. This paper which is derived from the findings of a larger study on perceptions and responses to the harmful health effects of carrying heavy firewood loads and to smoke from cooking fires is based on a study conducted in South Africa among managers of health programmes and community nurses of Qaukeni and Mhlontlo municipalities in rural Eastern Cape. Interviews and participant observations were conducted in 2009 using ethnographic grounded theory approaches. In addition to a 10-month period of ethnographic fieldwork, ten programme managers and nurses in two villages were interviewed about health patterns in the villages that they serve, their perceptions of, and responses to the health effects of carrying heavy firewood loads, and inhalation of smoke from wood and dung cooking fires, their professional qualifications and experience, their own household energy use; and observations made as they served clinic clients. Results show that these programme managers and nurses perceive the health effects of carrying heavy loads of firewood and of cooking smoke as minor. Sometimes, nurses give women symptomatic relief for musculoskeletal pain resulting from carrying heavy loads. We posit that their perceptions are derived from customary neglect of work-related health and non-communicable diseases, cultural interpretations of womanhood, limited access to relevant information, and limited interactions between health and energy sector professionals. We conclude that culturally and gender-sensitive awareness programmes are needed for local-level health professionals to effectively address health effects of biomass collection and use. This paper provides new insights into overlooked differences between globally-driven initiatives to address health effects of biomass use and local perceptions.},

This deployment resulted in detailed simultaneous measurements of surface wind speed, surface pressure and subsurface ocean temperature during and subsequent to storm passage. This represents the first time that such a self-consistent data set of surface conditions within a tropical cyclone has been collected. Subsequent NOAA research overflights of the buoys, as part of a hurricane planetary boundary-layer experiment, showed that aircraft wind speeds, extrapolated to the 20 m level, agreed to within ±2 m s−1, pressures agreed to within ±1 mb, and sea-surface temperatures agreed to within ±0.8°C of the buoy values. Ratios of buoy peak 1 min wind (sustained wind) to one-half h mean wind {\textgreater} 1.3 were found to coincide with eyewall and principal rainband features. Buoy trajectories and subsurface temperature measurements revealed the existence of a series of mesoscale eddies in the subtropical front. Buoy data revealed st...},

These include strong ({\textgreater} 40 dBZ) radar echoes extending$\backslash$nto great heights, high lightning flash rates, and very low brightness$\backslash$ntemperatures at 37 and 85 GHz. These are used as proxy variables,$\backslash$nindicating powerful convective updrafts.

TRMM's passive microwave$\backslash$nradiometer detects the large integrated ice water path as very low$\backslash$nbrightness temperatures, while high lightning flash rates are a physically$\backslash$nrelated but instrumentally independent indicator. The geographical$\backslash$nlocations of these very intense convective storms demonstrate strong$\backslash$nregional preferences for certain land areas while they are extremely$\backslash$nrare over tropical oceans. Favored locations include the south-central$\backslash$nUnited States, southeast South America, and equatorial Africa.

abstract = {The time-dependent freezing rate (TDFR) model here described represents the formation of ice particles by immersion freezing within an air parcel. The air parcel trajectory follows an adiabatic ascent and includes a period in time when the parcel remains stationary at the top of its ascent. The description of the ice nucleating particles (INPs) in the air parcel is taken from laboratory experiments with cloud and precipitation samples and is assumed to represent the INP content of the cloud droplets in the parcel. Time dependence is included to account for variations in updraft velocity and for the continued formation of ice particles under isothermal conditions. The magnitudes of these factors are assessed on the basis of laboratory measurements. Results show that both factors give rise to three-fold variations in ice concentration for a realistic range of the input parameters. Refinements of the parameters specifying time dependence and INP concentrations are needed to make the results more specific to different atmospheric aerosol types. The simple model framework described in this paper can be adapted to more elaborate cloud models. The results here presented can help guide decisions on whether to include a time-dependent ice nucleation scheme or a simpler singular description in models.},

Vulnerability caused by poverty, disease, lack of education, and poor living conditions exacerbates the problem. Air quality management plans identify prioritized strategies for improved air quality independent of consideration of vulnerability. A population exposure and vulnerability risk prioritization framework comprising five themes (air pollution sources; air pollution levels; air pollution potential; community awareness, observations, perceptions, and actions; and vulnerability factors) was proposed and applied to the eThekwini Municipality (Durban, South Africa). Data were scored according to predetermined risk threshold values to ascertain at-risk communities. While those urban wards located in a known air pollution hotspot had the highest air pollution levels, a periurban ward with moderate exposure levels was most vulnerable. This framework will prove invaluable for the development of focused interventions to reduce vulnerability and air pollution-associated adverse health impacts.},

Concentrations and vertical profiles of various fractions of airborne particulate matter suspended particulate {\v{Z}}. {\v{Z}} 10 2.5. Measurements were carried out using automated near real-time apparatus called the Kinetic Sequential Sampling {\v{Z}}. KSS system. KSS system is essentially an electronically-controlled lift carrying a real-time particle monitor for sampling air sequentially, at different heights within the breathing zone, which includes all heights within the surface layer of a street canyon at which people may breathe. Data is automatically logged at the different receptor levels, for the determination of the average vertical concentration profile of airborne particulate matter. For measuring the airborne particle concentration, a Grimm Dust Monitor 1.1045 was used. The recorded data also allows for time series analysis of airborne particulate matter concentration at different heights. Time series data and hourly-average vertical concentration profiles in the boundary layer of the confines of a street are thought to be mainly determined by traffic emissions and traffic associated processes. Hence the measured data were compared with results of a street {\v{Z}}. canyon emission-dispersion model in time and space. This Street Level Air Quality SLAQ model employs the plume-box technique and includes modules for simulating vehicle-generated effects such as thermally- and mechani- cally-generated turbulence and resuspension of road dust. Environmental processes, such as turbulence resulting from surface sensible heat and the formation of sulphate aerosol from sulphur dioxide exhaust emissions, are taken into account. The paper presents an outline description of the measuring technique and model used, and a comparison of the measured and modelled data.},

@article{gehring_2006,
abstract = {Background: Living close to major roads or highways has been suggested
to almost double the risk of dying from cardiopulmonary causes. We
assessed whether long-term exposure to air pollution originating
from motorized traffic and industrial sources is associated with
total and cause-specific mortality in a cohort of women living in
North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Methods: The study was a follow-up
of a series of cross-sectional studies carried out during the 1980s
and 1990s on the health of women (age 50-59 years). Approximately
4800 women were followed up for vital status and migration. Exposure
to air pollution was defined by distance to major roads calculated
from Geographic Information System data and by 1- and 5-year average
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particle (PM10) concentrations calculated
from air monitoring station data. We analyzed associations between
exposure and mortality using Cox's proportional hazards models adjusting
for confounders. Relative risks (RRs) refer to an interquartile range
increase in exposure (16 [mu]g/m3 for NO2; 7 [mu]g/m3 for PM10).
Results: During the follow-up period, 8{\%} of the women died, 3{\%}
from cardiopulmonary causes. Cardiopulmonary mortality was associated
with living within a 50-meter radius of a major road (adjusted RR
= 1.70; 95{\%} confidence interval = 1.02-2.81), with NO2 (1.57; 1.23-2.00
for 1-year average), and with PM10 (1.34; 1.06-1.71 for 1-year average).
Exposure to NO2 was also associated with all-cause mortality (1.17;
1.02-1.34). No association was seen with noncardiopulmonary nonlung
cancer mortality. Conclusions: Living close to major roads and chronic
exposure to NO2 and PM10 may be associated with an increased mortality
due to cardiopulmonary causes. (C) 2006 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins,

Here we validate a climate model, with and without indirect aerosol effects, by using satellite observations. The model agrees better with observations when both indirect aerosol effects are included. However, the simulated clouds are more susceptible to aerosols than the observed clouds from the POLDER satellite, thus overestimating the indirect aerosol effect. By taking the difference in susceptibilities into account, the global mean total anthropogenic aerosol effect is reduced from -1.4 to -0.85 watts per square meter.},

abstract = {This study is focused on producing a climatology of cloudiness over the Arabian Peninsula, one of the most arid regions worldwide. Spatial and temporal trends of four types of cloud amounts are developed and analyzed. Possible links with climate oscillations known to affect the region are explored. Satellite-based observations of cloud cover from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) and MODIS Terra Cloud Product are used, in addition to climate oscillation indices from the Climate Explorer. The most prominent finding from the temporal analysis of cloud cover trends over the region is that cloud amount averages appear to have undergone a statistically significant decreasing shift. Several theories are put forward as possible explanations for this trend. Spatial analyses displayed the variability of cloud amounts over the study area. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is found to possibly be linked to cloud cover trends during winter and summer months. The results highlight the profound need for further detailed studies in order to better understand this already under-defined and little explored field in the literature generally, and for the Arabian Peninsula specifically.},

abstract = {In this article, we address the problem of planning a network of weather monitoring stations observing average air temperature (AAT). Assuming the network planning scenario as a location problem, an optimization model and an operative methodology are proposed. The model uses the geostatistical uncertainty of estimation and the indicator formalism to consider in the location process a variable demand surface, depending on the spatial arrangement of the stations. This surface is also used to express a spatial representativeness value for each element in the network. It is then possible to locate such a network using optimization techniques, such as the used methods of simulated annealing (SA) and construction heuristics. This new approach was applied in the optimization of the Portuguese network of weather stations monitoring the AAT variable. In this case study, scenarios of reduction in the number of stations were generated and analysed: the uncertainty of estimation was computed, interpreted and applied to model the varying demand surface that is used in the optimization process. Along with the determination of spatial representativeness value of individual stations, SA was used to detect redundancies on the existing network and establish the base for its expansion. Using a greedy algorithm, a new network for monitoring average temperature in the selected study area is proposed and its effectiveness is compared with the current distribution of stations. For this proposed network distribution maps of the uncertainty of estimation and the temperature distribution were created.},

Algorithms to estimate the parameters of a gamma raindrop size distribution model from polarimetric radar observations of reflectivity, differential reflectivity, and specific differential phase are developed. Differential reflectivity is the most closely related measurement to a parameter of the drop size distribution, namely, the drop median diameter (D0). The estimator for D0 as well as other parameters are evaluated in the presence of radar measurement errors. It is shown that the drop median diameter can be estimated to an accuracy of 10{\%}, whereas the equivalent intercept parameter can be estimated to an accuracy of 6{\%} in the logarithmic scale. The estimators for the raindrop size distribution parameters are also evaluated using disdrometer data based simulations. The disdrometer based evaluations confirm the accuracy of the algorithms developed herein.},

abstract = {In recent years, sparse, surface-based air quality monitoring has
been improved by using wide-swath, satellite-derived aerosol products.
However, satellites are sensitive to the entire aerosol column, not
only the aerosol near the surface that impacts human health. In part
1 of this series, we used multiple regression to demonstrate how
inclusion of meteorological analyses can help constrain the surface
level proportion of the aerosol profile and improve the estimate
of surface PM2.5. Here, instead of multiple regression technique,
we describe an artificial neural network (ANN) framework that reduces
the uncertainty of surface PM estimation from satellite data. We
use 3 years of MODIS aerosol optical thickness data at 0.55 $\mu$m and
meteorological analyses from the rapid update cycle to estimate surface
level PM2.5 over the southeast United States (EPA region 4). As compared
to regression coefficients obtained through simple correlation (R
= 0.60) or multiple regression (R = 0.68) techniques, the ANN derives
hourly PM2.5 data that compare with observations with R = 0.74. For
estimating daily mean PM2.5, the ANN techniques results in correlation
of R = 0.78. Although the degree of improvement varies over different
sites and seasons, this study demonstrates the potential for using
ANN for operational air quality monitoring.},

The subject is not usually discussed explicitly within our profession. Scientists are expected to be smart enough to figure it out on their own and through the observation of their teachers.

abstract = {A new synthesis of information forming the foundation for rule-based systems to deduce dominant bulk hydrometeor types and amounts using polarimetric radar data is presented. The information is valid for a 10-cm wavelength and consists of relations that are based on an extensive list of previous and recent observational and modeling studies of polarimetric signatures of hydrometeors. The relations are expressed as boundaries and thresholds in a space of polarimetric radar variables. Thus, the foundation is laid out for identification of hydrometeor types (species), estimation of characteristics of hydrometeor species (size, concentrations, etc.), and quantification of bulk hydrometeor contents (amounts). A fuzzy classification algorithm that builds upon this foundation will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.},

@article{Ulbrich2007,
abstract = {This work uses raindrop size spectra measured at the surface in tropical continental storms to determine the associated parameters of the best-fit gamma distributions. The physical processes responsible for those parameters and their relations to the measurable radar reflectivity Z and differential reflectivity ZDR are then explored. So too are their relations to quantitative measurements of rain. Comparison is then made with corresponding features previously reported in tropical maritime regimes. The storms observed in Brazil and Arecibo, Puerto Rico, have been divided into convective (C), transition (T), and stratiform (S) seg- ments. The raindrop size distribution (DSD) parameters are clearly defined on a gamma parameter diagram (GPD) that shows 1) how median volume drop size D0 increases from S to T to C segments of the rain while 2) the range of the spectrum breadth parameter increases, and the range of the slope parameter decreases in the same sequence of S to C. Drop growth occurs predominantly below the 0C level by collision, coalescence, and breakup in the C rains. The median volume diameter D0 grows as more of the and increase. In both water is concentrated near that size and so the DSD narrows; that is, both maritime and continental storms the DSD in the convective portion of the storm approaches equilibrium. The coefficient A in the Z ARb relation increases with D0 while the exponent b approaches unity. The D0 and A pair increase with, and appear to be determined largely by, the updraft strength, thus providing a possible means of determining the appropriate algorithms for rainfall measurement. Although the small drop number samples measured by the surface disdrometer relative to the large volumes sampled by a radar 5 to 12 cannot tend to truncate the DSD at both small and large drop sizes, narrow distributions with be attributed to such an effect. Such narrow DSDs accord with common experience of monodispersed large drops at the beginning of a convective storm. There is also remarkable agreement of the surface-based observations of ZDRZD0 with the timespace variations from C to T to S rain types observed by radar in England and elsewhere. Because the C region of a storm often accounts for a major share of the rain accumulation despite its shorter duration, it is particularly important to measure that region more accu- rately. There are distinctive clusters of the generalized number parameter NW versus D0 between maritime and continental storms. Methods for remote sensing and parameterization must partition the rainstorms into convective, transition, and stratiform segments.},

Claims by the founders of Q method that hold that the procedure distances and removes the bias of the researcher are shown to be unfounded and epistemologically na{\"{i}}ve.

It is anticipated that by year 2019, the generation mix will be at 64{\%} coal, 32{\%} gas and 4{\%} hydro. Due to the increase in coal consumption for power generation, there is a critical need to evaluate the health risks for the population living in the vicinity of a coal-fired power plant in Malaysia. To date, such study related to the plant in Malaysia has never been published. In this study, health risk assessment (HRA) for air emission from a coal-fired power plant in Malaysia was carried out. Two pollutants from the Proposed New Environmental Quality (Clean Air) Regulation 201X (Draft) (i.e. SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and Hg) were assessed for non-carcinogenic health risk, and two trace elements (i.e. As and Cr) were assessed for carcinogenic health risk. Both short-term and long-term health effects were evaluated. Air dispersion modelling (AERMOD) was used to predict the ground level concentration (GLC) within 10 km radius of the emission source. Based on the HRA, different health risks were identified for short-term and long-term dispersion of the studied pollutants. The findings indicate that a detailed assessment on the short-term and long-term health effects of the emissions from coal-fired power plant in Malaysia with meteorological factor as one of the significant factors influencing the emissions level is needed.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to provide a summary overview of the African energy sector and briefly examine the nexus of poverty and energy in the region. While the paper uses continent-wide data, the emphasis is placed on sub-Saharan Africa--the region where the need to improve modern energy services for the poor is particularly acute. For readers who are unfamiliar with Africa, the paper starts with a succinct review of the continent's key demographic and socio-economic characteristics. The paper then, presents important elements of the continent's energy consumption and supply sub-sectors. It ends with the identification of key drivers that are likely to decide the future direction of the sub-Saharan Africa's energy sector. The paper stresses that these key drivers will, to a significant extent, determine the latitude that the region's decision makers will have in tackling the enormous challenge of meeting the modern energy needs of sub-Saharan Africa's poor},
